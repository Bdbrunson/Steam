The taming process was pretty intense so it really made me want to keep my Raptor safe. I saddled him up and decided to give him a go. He was amazing, we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me. \\nAfter I respawned back at my base I was in panic mode and jumped on my only other ride able Dino which was a Parasaur and hauled♥♥♥♥♥back to where my raptor was. We never made it. About halfway there we were attacked by a pack of raptors and both were killed. My next re-spawn was kinda bleak from the start. I re-spawn in a random location that I thought would be near my Dino. After what seemed like hours of carefully navigating my map back to where i though my Dino was I started to freeze and starve. I would move thirty to fifty feet and whistle then repeat. The sun went down and my hopes for recovering my dino with it. Just as I had given up hope I was surrounded by scorpions and I thought \"oh well\". A second later my Raptor jumped down from the rocky ledges above and killed one of the scorpions. I frantically jumped on his back and ran from the other scorpions. My health was still falling due to the cold and me starving. Once we got to relative safety I hopped off his back and checked his inventory. Somehow he had collected a full suit of armor and plenty of berries whilst we were hunting earlier. We eventually dodged meat eaters and found our way home once the sun rose. \\nI have never felt that since of disparity and relief from a video game before. It sounds funny but it really felt like the raptor saved my life. I\\'ve never got that into a game before. That one experience was worth more than what I paid for the game.',\n",
       " \"Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefing, I feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers.\\nRight now I got close to 130 hours in the game, about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvE, all official ones. All the thing people say about the griefers is true, they'll kill your dinos, steal your stuff, abuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And that's the keyword here TRIBES. If you're playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that you're not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with it's little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourself, taking everything in, eventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth.\\nI'm sorry but I got to burst your bubble right now: If you plan on playing in a PvP server you gotta take this game seriously. You either find a group of friends to play with you or you join a Tribe as soon as possible. If you play alone you might find a hidden spot where your stuf will be safe one or two nights, maybe even a week, but alone you're doomed to be found, robbed and killed. And like many others said, have the work of a whole week go down the drain. If you're joining a PvP server you're doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure you, thing can get really intense, really epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deaths, or tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havok, T-Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at them, auto-turrets spewing bullets at your Carno army, Sabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold.\\nBut you'll only experience that if you join one of the dominating tribes on your server or work on creating a strong Tribe of your own. Otherwise you'll just be cattle for them, nothing else. They'll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccess, block caverns so only they can harvest the resources, literally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on.\\nI get why so much people hate that, after all they're just being preayed upon, they're not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right now, they gotta allow people to be complete a-holes because during wars that's what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale.\\nBut if everything I said right now put you off, don't be. First of all because you don't really need PvP for this game to be fun. There's a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinos, just hit level 45, and I feel like I'll never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE servers, they'll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rex, help you gather Prime meat when you're taming a Carnivore, give you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them.\\nAnd if you're still one of the guys who wanna grow at your pace and only participate on PvP when you're ready, REJOICE! Because they'll soon add War Declaration to PvE servers, so tribes can actually go at war when they feel like it, without all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves.\\nAs a closing statement, I'd like to congratulate the Devs. They're doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT better, still not there yet, but much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarer, in fact I don't even remember the last time I experienced one.\\nAn all around great game that I fully recommend if you're into dinossaurs and survival games. Oh, and it's also pretty cheap.\",\n",
       " \"Note: At least 1000 of my hours were spent on Official Servers. Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers.\\nArk Survival Evolved is a game that will make you feel many things.  Initially you will feel frustration at your helplessness as you spawn nude on a beach at level one and can barely fend off the smallest of dinosaurs.  Then you will meet people, these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and over, or they will be really chill, and you'll form a tribe with them.  You will spend countless hours with these people: farming materials, taming dinosaurs, and build bases.  You will grow more and more in power.  You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down.  You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e. the big tribes or friendly tribes).  You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribes, French and German, all while growing more and more powerful.  You will on occassion have a set back, but at this point you're on a roll and now the games mechanics, have a good group of friends, and objectives that you have given yourself.  You will feel happy with what you have accomplished.  \\nBut there is a downside.  There must always be conflict, while it can be delayed for long periods of time, it will eventually come.  And so another tribe will pick a fight with you.  Your tribe will fight their tribe, and you may lose or you may win.  Either way you've invested a lot into this server and these friends, so you'll never give up.  Some other tribes will jointhe fight, picking sides.  The winning side will probably kill all the dinos, take all the mats, and kill everyone on the losing side.  Thus you have won your first war.  You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with.  Soon enough, you'll get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well.  Now the entire server is split 50-50, and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases.  Eventually you'll win though, and the other side will leave the server.  They'll be fed up.  As the enemies are now gone, you are happy once more.  You hated them just as they hated you.  \\nNow a long period of peace has passed, a couple weeks.  There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting.  Peace will try to be maintained through talks.  But it will fail in the end, and more war will arise.  This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain.  These two tribes will be dominant in every regard: leadership, tactics, dinosaurs, and materials.  Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server.  You will fight your heart out against your former allies.  You will destroy bases you'd once entered as a friend, now as an enemy.  You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with.  You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours.  The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end.  It will be exhilerating.\\nThen you win.  Then you are the supreme ruler of the server.  You are standing over the ruins of your former allies as you have proved yourself to be the mightiest.  But then it will hit you.  The sadness. As now all the people you had once known, months ago when you were just a little tribe starting out, will all be gone.  Everyone you'd ever fought with and fought against are gone.  While there is some joy in victory, it is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with.  Your tribemates will still play, but it's not the same.  Even if not in your tribe, you had a community. Friends. Foes. Maybe even lovers.  Now all that is gone.  You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart.  New people will always arrive to challenge you, but you'll always beat them down.  Destroying any hope they had.  You'll build fortresses that'll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos it'll cause server lag.  You'll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power.  Finally, you'll get bored and leave.\\nMonths will pass, and one day you'll see Ark still in your library and hop back on.  You'll log back into your old server.  Everything is different.  New names, faces, bases, everything.  Not a single structure you had built is left standing, not a single ruin.  All of it is gone.  The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that 'Ark can be harsh for noobs', but you could never tell them.  You could never tell them an entire servers history.  The hundreds of thousands of hours of work you'd seen put in by that ancient world.  The structures they couldn't ever even imagine.  The wars you'd fought and people you'd met.  You could never explain to them what it all had meant to you, for it is all now gone.  In it's place is a new world, completely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity.  You will be both extremely happy at this new world, and profoundly sad about the world that was lost.\\nArk Survival Evolved will demand dozens of hours to just get the basics down and get priorities straight.  To become a power on a server will take about a hundred hours.  To conquer a server will take a couple hundred hours.  To realize everything you lost and destroyed that you once held dear will take thousands of hours.  To atone for everything you'd done to those you once called friends will take an eternity.\\nIf you'll pour time and effort, no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions you've made than Ark: Survival Evolved.  Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game.  But you'll meet people you'd never have met otherwise, see things you never thought possible, commit acts that would make tyrants think you're true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ.  In the end, you'll feel stronger emotions then any you've ever felt from playing a game.\\n10/10 Masterpiece.\",\n",
       " 'I have over 200 hours into the game, compared to a lot of ARK players i\\'m still a noob so if you aren\\'t ready to turn this into a full time job, don\\'t even bother thinking about getting this game. I\\'ll explain why this game is a full time job later on, but basically it punishes any player that can\\'t or won\\'t play it 24/7. \\nFirst I\\'ll talk about the PvE. I started playing PvE on a private server with friends and had tons of fun discovering everything there is to enjoy. We started on The Center, the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps. The beginning is the hardest part for new players. Every dino you meet can easily kill a noob, even the spitter dinos. It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptors, but stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place. Once you get the base built, the game gets so much more fun. Every new dino you find is cool, and it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave. The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators. Our base got killed multiple times by alpha raptors, but it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and gaurd towers, there was still a threat out there that had to be beaten. Ofcourse once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymore and once you tame flying mounts you don\\'t have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring. We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challenge, and even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill? Harder versions of that boss? That\\'s why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game.\\nPro tip, don\\'t PvP. This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top. New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave. Let\\'s walk through all the reason PvP is horrible.\\n1.) Alpha tribes. They wipe the server once or twice a week and completly blow up any new players base and kill their dinos. They own the server, they won\\'t let anyone else even enjoy the game.\\n2.) Unless you\\'re alpha, you don\\'t get a base, they might let you live in a thatch hut. Refer to reason 1.) \\n3.) Unless you\\'re alpha, you don\\'t get to tame dinos, they might let you tame dodos. Refer to reason 1.)\\n4.) Unless you\\'re alpha, you don\\'t get to upgrade any of your gear. Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto-turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them.\\n5.) Alpha tribes are literally impossible for smaller tribes to fight. They have huge metal bases with hundreds and hunderds of turrets and plants that will mow you down if you so much as look at it wrong. Rockets get shot down in mid air by these turrets, and you won\\'t get close enough to plant c4. You won\\'t be able to bring dinos to tank the turret either, refer to 1.)\\n6.) Offline-raiding. Just imagine working for 2-3 weeks building a pretty cool base completely surrounded by plant-x and taming about 20 dinos then logging on to see a smoking crater where you base was. You don\\'t get to save any of your gear, you don\\'t get to save any of your dinos, you don\\'t even get to fight back, it\\'s all just gone. This happens all the time, and honestly offline-raid protection should be baseline on all servers.\\n7.) Battlemetrics. Alpha tribes and griefers use this website to figure out if you are online or not. If you log off for some reason, sleep or work or whatever, then they will know and they will raid you. They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or on, or if anything else unusual is going on on \"their\" server. Basically, this site and sites like it are cancer. Also, it doesn\\'t tell them your in game name, but you steam name, that means even if you make another character they will know it\\'s you. Also, if you♥♥♥♥♥♥them off and try to go to another server, they can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you. There is no hiding and no escape, so you have to be nice and can\\'t even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to.\\n8.) Breeding. Just another way to keep big tribes ontop. They have huge metal air-conditioned rooms where they hatch 20 eggs at once, each hatched dino gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will have.\\n9.) Tek gear. If the fact that they have 2-3x better gear by monopolizing all loot crates wasn\\'t a big enough edge, if the fact that they have 2-3x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasn\\'t a big enough edge, now they get tek gear too. If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinos, you are DEAD!\\n10.) Ark is a full-time job. You must log on every day to feed dinos or they will die. Breeding and imprinting are horrible and time consuming processes that I won\\'t even touch. You must log on every day to make sure you haven\\'t been raided, and you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders. Don\\'t try, you won\\'t. \\nLook, I\\'m tired of typing this review, just know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skill, then don\\'t PvP. No Pvp skill required at this point, their gear will have much higher armor and damage, their dinos will have much higher hp and damage, just accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you won\\'t even be online to defend it, not like you\\'d have a chance if you were.\\nEDIT:\\nI never expected my review to actually be popular, but now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that I\\'m still a noob who doesn\\'t know what he\\'s talking about.\\nFirstly, this is NOT a skill based game. This is a grind based, offline raid based, exploit based game. You can\\'t come here and say I\\'m a noob, especially when I\\'ve played the game solo as a small tribe for over 300 hours, and I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale. My opinion actually got even worse after joining the aplha tribe, because I realized just how bad the game panders to these alpha tribes. Here are some more reasons I found from my time with the alphas why I will never recommend this game to anyone.\\n1.) Alpha tribes can grind resources WAY easier than a new player. Now, you would probably expect this. After all, they have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1. No, numbers isn\\'t even what I\\'m talking about here, I\\'m talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal. A noob with a hatchet can get 50-60 wood from a single tree. An alpha tribe can get 1500 wood from a single tree. A noob with a pickaxe can get 50-60 metal from a vein, an alpha tribe can get 300 metal from a vein. A noob would take hours to farm 1-2k metal, an alpha tribe can farm 20-30k metal in an hour. The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier. Now, noobs wont know how to do this, and wouldn\\'t be able to because Quetzals are hard to tame, and hard to hide from alpha tribes. If they saw you flying around harvesting, they would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your base.\\n2.) Large scale PvP is extremely laggy. The servers are supposed to support up to 100 players, but if you get more than 20 players in a server, the lag becomes unbearable. Once again, Alpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server (kind of like DDOS) to block out defenders from connecting, or to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from things.',\n",
       " \"First review i wrote for a game but it had to be done!\\nThis game is like Crack! \\nI've put a few hundred hours into this game and will probably put in a few hundred more. The devs are constantly pushing out new content (to a point where all the server maintenance is starting to become annoying haha) and they are very involved with the community trough reddit etc. \\nMe and two friends of mine started off on a public server and had a really nice welcoming, A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we we're hooked to the game pretty much instantly. There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone.\\nA few weeks later. \\nwe have a huge metal base with a 5 high stone wall perimiter around it and 5 more people joined our tribe. All the big tribes but the chinese one left the server and got wiped out. And it seemed peaceful At this point we already spent hundreds of hours taming different dinos (which each have their different role like gathering resources, carrying heavy loads, transportation, combat, you name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t-rexes and the stronger end game dino's. You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dino's as well which makes the game even better.\\nOne week later.\\n Random (smaller tribes) are getting destroyed at night when they are offline. all the buildings blown open resources stolen and dinos killed. (take note some dinos can take over 10 hours to tame without kibble) At this point our base is more like a fortress we have over 70 organic turrets (think plants that split acid to hostiles) and 10 auto Gatlin turrets with loads of ammo in them. And an army of all kinds of dino's over 50 including 5 t-rexes varying from lvl 150-200+ A fully metal layered base with different compartments with different resources in every room (makes it harder for raiders to get everything since they have to blow up more walls) \\nThe chinese tribe starts putting in random text in global chat in capital letters including our tribe name. they have always helped us out we have made multiple trades with them for resources and called them allies. \\nThe next day. \\nI log on.\\nEverything is gone.... all our dino's are dead every wall is blown up all our turrets taken out. and our base is in ruins. \\nHundreds of hours of building up Taming dino's training them taking them out on resource runs and working together with a tribe....gone....\\nThe chinese tribe who helped us out from day one, Destroyed us.\\nRIP.\\nAtlas\\nAbraxis\\nNien\\nTalon\\nAeon\\nMckitten\\nMcCat\\nMcMuffin\\nMike the trike\\nBob the trike\\nArmageddon\\nMorgoth\\nApocalypse \\nAnkrahmun\\nAnkaderp\\nMuffin\\nDeem\\nDemonspawn\\nSharkenator\\nLulu\\nRammus\\nRockey\\nStoney\\nScorpenator\\nMitten\\nRappy\\nOmega\\nMammutan\\nWoolly\\nMamenamenamenan\\nCarny\\nBrontenator\\nAnd many more....\\nThat empty hollow feeling seeing your base in ruins and all your tamed fed and cared for dino's dead. I never had that before in a game.\\n3 days later.\\n we set up camp a few miles west from our old base. we had primitive tools and we were back to square one. \\nBut we we're determined and longing for revenge.... \\nwe broke down some old metal walls en made a small 4x4 room and set up the basic crafting stations. We had good contact with a few of the smaller tribes nearby who we helped out countless of times. now we needed their help. we secretly banded together against the Chinese tribe and they gave us some of the harder to obtain resources like crystal and oil.\\nWe started mass producing grenades.\\nI went out at night with a stash of metal tools a crossbow, arrows and food and approached their base. The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dino's in. I went to the beach. swam underneath the base. found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside. Found a good spot and made a start. tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall. Out came charging a T-rex and 5 raptors at insane speed. we started backing off while firing at them. The water slowed them down. Called for the rest of the tribe to head over. we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons. After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead. That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable. but we weren't satisfied. We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farm, we killed over 20 Stego's three mammoths and a few ankylo's, It was a massacre. Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends. \\nToday, \\nwe're still fighting a guerrilla style war against the Chinese. Constantly on the move hitting them where they expect it the least.\\nOnly a handfull of people remain on the server but we won't rest untill we have taken everything from them... like they did to so many others.\\nApoligies for the grammar mistakes etc. English is not my native language. \",\n",
       " \"I'm at a point where I'm about to hit 20 solid hours of gaming and feel I have a good enough grasp of the game to review it. So here goes...\\nI'm 32 years old. Been gaming since the Atari... been online since the early 90's. Done everything from chat based roleplay to full blown massive MMO's. I have a few hundred games on Steam and others on Origin, GoG, etc.\\nLet me say that this is the FIRST time I have EVER seen a developer quite like this one.\\nMake no mistake, this is an Early Access title. So of course the launch was plagued with issues, and the server numbers didn't cover the 100,000+ players... BUT, the devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that I've ever seen.\\nIn the first 24 hours of the game... we had over a dozen patches. In the first 48 hours... I can't even count how many. I recall yesterday having downloaded over 10 different patches through Steam. Seemed like one every hour. \\nFor me, that's HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product. You just don't see this type of response at all from an indie, or AAA team.\\nThat said... the game is pretty fun and exciting. I'd describe it best as Rust, with dinosaurs. Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine. The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release).\\nIn all, you can't go wrong picking this title up at this point. Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fine.\",\n",
       " \"+ Dinosaurs\\n+ Sprawling land that looks and feels absolutely huge\\n+ Ease of Understanding (controls, objectives, etc)\\n+ Engram System (I really dig it)\\n+ Simple Crafting (It's a no brainer to use and understand)\\n+ Early Access Perks (cosmetic items which are dinky but cool)\\n+ Loot Boxes! \\n+ Taming and Mounts (epicness)\\n+ Single Player (has been added!)\\n+ Server Hosting Instructions have been shared\\n+ PvE/PvP commands have been added for server hosting!\\n- Optimization: Needs massive improvement (which is happening! it's a priority with the Devs atm)\\n- Not enough servers to meet the current population\\n- Not being able to connect to servers/being kicked out of servers\\n- Sound issues (music/sound not turning down properly even when adjusted) \\n- Lag issues across the board. (Some experience it, some do not.)\\n- Raptors (dude, they will own your butt unless you hit a hill or something. Not really a Con, they're just d*cks)\\nWhat little I've managed to play I have enjoyed and really look forward to pitching a tent and staying a good long while but I'm not going to sugarcoat my experience either. There are a lot of problems right now but most of them are due to the Devs simply not pushing a bigger server test before they released -- They simply didn't anticipate the community that slammed their servers trying to play.\\nI'm recommending it, but please keep in mind that this is a VERY Early Access game despite the fact that there is a lot about it that simply looks, and somewhat feels, polished (the dinosaurs are amazing). If you cannot or do not want to deal with the current CONS then you should wait at least a week and come back and check out the changes the Devs push otherwise I'm saying go ahead and drop the 24.89$USD and try your hand at playing.\\nEDIT: 6/2 - Single Player and Hosting Commands have been added by the Devs!\",\n",
       " 'UPDATE: This game holds the record for largest sized game that isn\\'t released. Actually it holds the record for largest sized game period. Like why duh fug is it 108gb? even when it only downloads 30 it still allocates 108gb from my drive. And I have 100\\'s of games. Used to be 200\\'s until I wanted ARK back.\\nBEFORE YOU PLAY THE GAME\\n1.) Change inventory keybinding to Tab. Make console \"~\" Plays off very fluent.\\n2.) 5,000+ Negative reviews about optimization, You need more than just a great graphics card. This game is more CPU          dependant, I\\'m using an old 550gtx card and runs pretty smooth and with custom video settings it looks just fine. Tweak with everything for a few minutes, you\\'ll find a good enjoyable setting. Unless you\\'re running an old IBM pc. (lol)\\n3.) Note that you can customize your character down to hand size, male/female, etc. My only downside is somehow I still look the same as everyone.\\nOFF TO THE GAMEPLAY\\n1.) Unique inventory system, you have a mysterious impant in your hand which is the HUD for everything. You learn how to craft everything without a single blueprint through engrams, which better items require certain higher level. There are blueprints to find for a shortcut, but you never Really need them. EDIT: Blueprints can be BETTER than just the original engram I.E higher armor or durability. Survival is basic eat/drink over time it decays like rust, etc.\\n2.) Supply Drops, (I assume everyone is a test subject sent to this planet and these drops are hi tech packages warped to the land by the Army/Scientist) are also unique rather than a box that falls from a random helicopter. They are level restricted from level 5 to level 45 (so far I\\'ve seen). Can drop nearly anything in the game. I.E. Level 5 drop gave me an entire 1 square house, door and all. Drops have a cool and unique item model and the way drops work is just sci-fi-ish and refreshing.\\n3.) Crafting is Very seamless, pretty much a basic system though, which works just fine for replayablity. Repairs are on the spot until you get better items then you\\'ll use the Smithy. You can refine items so they won\\'t break when you level higher.\\n4.) Weather system/Temperature is neat. You get hot and cold, leading to burning or freezing to death after a long while. So far I\\'ve only seen rain and heavy fog as far as precipitaion. Hopefully while server days pass and development continues We will see snow and disasters such as tornados, typhoons, etc.\\n5.) Combat. Let\\'s be frank. Task Manager Says is all under processes = \"Shooter Game\" Basic swing and strike for melee. Iron sights for ranged. Online combat is sketchy due to ping. But Singleplayer/Local is very solid. There are multiple weapon attachments as well. \\n6.) Physics in the game are great, due to Unreal 4. But I will ADD THE FALLING DAMAGE NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED. At first I died nearly encumbered falling from maybe a 3 meter drop (thinking, oh I had alot on me it would hurt more). Only to die off the same drop being naked to get my gear back. So water, landscapes, foliage, all great. But FALLING DAMAGE NEEDS TO BE REDUCED. \\n7.) Dinosaurs (they are currently adding a multitude of species). Right now there are maybe a dozen different dinos and animals. Like a sabertooth tiger, mammoth, sharks etc. All very well produced and modeled. Sometimes pathing is a little bad, I kill T-Rex\\'s and Bronto just because they get stuck in trees or up a mountain side. Other than that, all dinos attack as they should and look great doing so. The taming method is very tedious, but unique. If you USE a nonlethal weapon on a dino they will go unconsious, which will have a meter telling you how long, and also a meter bar for taming. You simply place the food in their \"inventory\" wait and protect. Simple yet tedious. Making saddles are level required as well. (i\\'m to the point in local-play to just \"~ ForceTame\")\\n8.) Building is best described as rust or h1z1. Simple place foundation and addon. Yet there are alot of extra things you can do, such as catwalks, ladders, water pipes to transport a water source 17423 miles away. Also pipes can help you find your way around areas (I used some as placements and arrows). There is a modern aspect to building as well. Such as air conditioners, refridgerators, lamps, turrets, all need to be powered by generator and electrical wires. So that\\'s a grade A move, on my part. Also if you play online just simply beware, this is a survival game. Meaning people are psycho.\\n9.) Finally last and foremost, you can defecate,♥♥♥♥♥♥ poop, take a number two, talk to a horse named john, pop a squat, and pick it right up to fertilize your crops (which is VERY nessecary in my case)\\nSO OVERALL\\nThis game is still in development, it does have it\\'s lower qualities, which I mentioned. BUT, I can see why this game is coming to my Xbox One and PS4, rather than Rust, Dayz (never happening), H1Z1 (who is really gunna play that?), or many other survival games. It is simply because this game has all of the qualities of a AAA game and showed them to a playable extent, which companies like Steam, Sony, and Microsoft will gladly support. And for people who have not been able to play the game. Buy it on your Next Gen console because \"PC master race, right?\" \\nThanks to anyone who reads this long a$$ review. I\\'ve enjoyed the game, killed Broodmother and now resting as a humble Turok. I do think you should try it out before it is bought out by the $60 greedy game publishers. It is fooking worth it.',\n",
       " 'After a few hours playing i just felt i had to type down something about the game. First off the game looks realy nice, no way i could say it was a early access game if i didnt know it alrdy. No major game breaking buggs so far, some bigger dinos stuck between trees but so far i just seen a handfull of them.\\nA few highlight of my gameplay\\nWoke up on a beach and started to get the feel of the game and controls. Looking around  i saw another player working his way  thoward the forest and i tough: hey ill stalk him and see what hes up to. a few 100 meters into the dence forest he gets attacked by what i think was a Trex feeling for a snack. i didnt stay to check what happend to the guy, i legged back to the beach where i woke up. \\nNext few hours i was working my hardest just to get though the nights without falling to the smaller reptiles prowling the beach. Though to myself after makeing a spear, fish should be easy food to catch, I swam out to a big boulder just where the sea got alittle deeper, spotting a fish getting rdy to jump into the water and spearing it i saw a big shadow comming closer.... a shark the size of 2 cars....\\nI spend a cold night out on that rock.\\nWorking my way north along the shoreline looking for a good spot to call home i came across a dino that was left for dead that i decided to tamed. Over a period of 3 ingame days and nights feeding it and defending it and me the entire time. Gathering berries and makeing a campfire to cook myslef some meat and for light for the night times. After 3 long night and days he finaly woke up and i had my first companion.\\nFor a time all was well i was building the house on a hill loverlooking the shore, My dino i came to call Fido was defending me and the house without mercy. Oneday i felt the gound shake as a pack of big herbivores deciced that my house was totaly in the wrong place and started to attack it. Fido the good guard dog as he was attacked without delay. Outnumberd and outpowerd we fought them side by side for almost 30 min killing off 6 of the 8 attackers when Fido didnt have anymore fight in him and fell to the ground to never raise again. I without any backup was no match for the remaining two and i had to fall back into my house and gather as mutch of my resources i could carry and the flee. The only thing i could do was to watch from afar with my spyglass the destruction of my house and mourn the death of my brave Fido. \\nWould i recomend to buy it? Hell yes :)',\n",
       " 'This story requires a bit of setup.\\nLast year, a friend of mine whom I\\'d known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a \"Grandmaster\" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.\\nFlash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it\\'s so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.\\nOn Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn\\'t show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it\\'s difficult to accept that we\\'ll be going it alone now.\\nWe contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.\\nI not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can\\'t wait for).\\nThanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.',\n",
       " 'If you\\'re here at the crossroads asking yourself \"Destiny 2 or Warframe?\" - then perhaps this review might clear a few things up for you!\\nTo start with I have around 190 hours at the time of writing review and I approximately started playing Warframe around 3 weeks ago. I initially was looking for a game to keep me occupied whilst waiting for the Destiny 2 PC release.\\nNow I played Destiny 1 non-stop, I mean I grinded that game so hard for 4 months, achieved absolutely everything possible, obtained everything and then never touched it again. Don\\'t get me wrong, I LOVED those 4 months. But this isn\\'t a review about Destiny, but rather about Warframe... And man is it a good game!\\nWarframe at times can feel a bit overwhelming, there certainly isn\\'t  the type of hand-holding that Bungie provide you with in Destiny. Whilst this hand holding can seem helpful at the start, it soon turns into a glass ceiling. Forcing you to go in a particular direction or playstyle - there is non of this in Warframe. \\nIn Warframe the universe is an open book and you approach it however you would like. There is a general linear progression to the missions, you unlock one planet move onto a next and so on, but warframe really lets you choose how you tackle this. The weapon system in Warframe is a prime example of how open it is: You can pick a starter gun, and because of 100\\'s of mods available, this starter weapon can still kick a** in mid to end game! Every Primary, secondary and melee weapon feels unique and there are so many ways to alter these weapons: Want a machine gun that sets enemies alight? No problem, just add a Fire Mod! Want a bow that fires 2 arrows instead of 1? No problem, add a multi-shot mod! Want both of those? No problem, add both mods!\\nThat\\'s just the weapons, wait till you try the warframes! There are about 30 or so different warframes (basically characters) and each has 4 unique abilities. Each warframe is suited to a particular purpose: You like to control the sea and summon a Kraken to throw enemies about? Hydroid\\'s your guy! You like to set every enemy on fire and watch the world burn? Ember\\'s who you\\'re after! Want to heal the rest of your teammates and be the lifeline of the team? Trinity is here! And guess what? Yepp, you can mod these just like you mod the weapons: Want more shield on your tanky Rhino warframe? No problem, we got that! Want more energy to keep using your abilities? Eyyy yepp that too! And that\\'s just 2 examples out of hundreds!\\nCompanions I heard you say? Oh yeah well in Destiny you have a futuristic rubix cube who attempts to make jokes. Whilst in Warframe you have about 6 different companions, 4 war wolves, some cat/fox breed and an epic looking alien bull! All of which have their unique abilities and purpose... And yes you guessed it: You can also mod them!\\nNext is customisation... Now wow oh wow is this impressive. Warframe lets you customise pretty much about everything. On a warframe you can add skins, you can add armor pieces, you can add sigils (tattoo type things), you can add capes, you can change helmet style and you can change the colour of every single one of these pieces and aspects. The same goes for your companions and weapons. Also you can customise the colour and skin of your ship, you can even change the colour of the walls inside your ship! There\\'s ALOT to customise in this game, it\\'s quite impressive.\\nNow at this stage you\\'re probably saying: \"Yeah well I heard you gotta buy in-game currency to get access to this awesome stuff.\" Incorrect! Warframe has a whole in-game market/trading system that often fuels the crafting system. Meaning that you can sell the drops you get from certain missions to other players for the in-game currency. Or you can keep it for yourself and once you\\'ve got all the bits you can craft it! Either way you will eventually earn platinum and be able to buy the epic stuff you wanted.\\nLastly, the community. This is perhaps one of the nicest and most pleasant social aspects of Warframe. The community is so close, kind and caring. People have always helped me and some even gave me free stuff! This really is unique in an online game and boy is it nice to see.\\nAll in all, I came to Warframe to keep me occupied and now I\\'m hooked. I STRONGLY recommend you try Warframe, you will not be disappointed. Great work DE!\\n* EDIT 1: Thank you all for your thumbs up, feedback and comments! I\\'ll do my best to answer a few valid points that I\\'ve seen come up in the past week or in the comments.\\n1) \"Certain Warframes are OP\" - Well Yes and No, I don\\'t think the term over-powered can be used here. I think certain Warframes are more USEFUL than others, but then again that will entirely depend on what mission or purpose you are doing. For example: Sure I can run through a difficult Spy mission with Ember (an incredibly offensive fire based Warframe) but I will have an easier and smoother time tackling it with Ash (a stealthy, silent, single target based Warframe).\\nIt\\'s also important to remember that a Warframe, weapon or even companion is only as powerful as the mods you put on it. Meaning that you can completely transform a warframe from something \"meh\" to something godly just by using the right mods, and good ones too! But remember, the better the mods, the harder they are to find / more expensive they are to buy with plat!\\n2) \"The graphics are horrible\" - I\\'m going to use World of Warcraft to demonstrate my point here (I\\'m sure there are many other examples, but WoW is the one I can think of right now!): - World of Warcraft is a long-running game and like in Warframe, the often beginner areas (which were created right at the start of the game) look barren and terrible. This is somewhat true about the first few planets in Warframe, certain areas at the start look lifeless and without depth BUT as you progress, the planets become more detailed and graphically nicer.\\nFurthermore, recently DE just remastered Earth (the first planet) and it looks MUCH nicer! So be patient, DE definitely know that certain areas look crud and they are working on it I\\'m sure! I expect more planets will get a make-over just like Earth in the near future.\\n3) \"Plains of Eidolon is boring and filled with bugs \" - Okay sure, Plains of Eidolon (the newest, semi-open world area) is not entirely what we expected but think of this: This is the first time DE have attempted anything like it, they clearly said prior to the release that they were expecting feedback and will continue to add more content to PoE. They are a small studio and don\\'t necessarily have the resources that large studios like Blizzard or Activision might have. Give them time, give them feedback and be patient. I am almost certain that in the coming weeks DE will be adding more content and tweaking the existing stuff to make it smooth and enjoyable.\\nAlso, Plains of Eidolon is not meant to be the bulk of the game, there are still many other planets and things to do! It\\'s just a new area in an existing planet. Everyone chill and give DE some room to breathe and work things out, they have in the past and they will do so now too.\\nThanks again all!',\n",

       " 'Warframe is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I\\'ve had moments were I really loved it and there have been numerous moments where I\\'ve wanted to smash my desk with a sledgehammer. \\nI\\'ll just write a short and simple review.\\nCombat - 8/10\\nReally satisfying and fast. But the late game can get stressful and too hectic.\\nMovement - 7/10\\nMostly same as above, but what brings it down a bit is the numerous enemies that kill your momentum and the Co-op elements.\\nMultiplayer - 5/10\\nGreat in the beginning but it really gets dragged down in the higher levels where all players just speed around the map to the objectives and it starts to feel more like a speedrun. I always found it annoying when people would just race past enemies and do all these exploits just to get through the level faster and I would struggle to keep up.\\nStory - ?/10\\nI don\\'t have much to say since the story is unfinished, but the little that I\\'ve seen thus far is pretty interesting.\\nVisuals - 8,5/10\\nAbsolutely stunning. The lighting really makes the game. It\\'s so bright and vivid, and it runs great I might add. And I really like the designs for all the different warframes and cosmetics.\\nMissions and objectives- 5/10\\nThis is sadly the weakest point of the game. The missions and levels get really repetetive and grindy. And trying to get new gear can sometimes take weeks. (Including build times) This is the part where you\\'re really reminded that this is a F2P game. I would\\'ve prefered to pay for a full game with less of a grind since I\\'ve already spent way more than 60$ on rushing items and buying cosmetics. I\\'ll add that I\\'m not a fan of grinding (which is why I\\'ve spent so much money on the game.), I know some people are and kudos to you if you\\'re into that stuff but I\\'m not.\\nKeep in mind that these are my personal opinions and experiences.

Why not try it? \\nWarframe, a universe thriving with lush, hidden lore. The place where a species of technologically crude, and industrious Grineer have made home. The place where a plutocratic, advanced, and money greedy Corpus have made home. The place where a technocyte plague known as the Infestation has made home. Ah, and of course.. the place where you, the noble, honorable, Tenno; have made home. \\nWarframe is a free to play done right, everything in this game can be earned for completely free. You know how I know? Well, I\\'ve been getting EVERYTHING for free, and have spent a fair amount of hours to get this info!\\nThis game has thousands of mods. Unlike its \\'comparable\\' Destiny, this game has more than a dumbed down skill tree. This game has a modding system. One which lets your power have billions of stat combos.\\nThis game allows for player to player trading. Whether you\\'re looking for \\'prime\\' gear, or platinum (premium currency), trading has you covered. There are people willing to trade you for mods, gear, and platinum.\\nThe UPDATES, now this is a big one. This game Warframe has had so many updates, nearly on a monthly basis that it could EASILY have had a Warframe 2 by now. For a game being completely free, these updates are WELL worth your time. I mean hell, for the first time, we\\'re getting an enormous expansion adding open worlds! (which we all know will be expanded to every planet).\\nThe memorable moments. One, undeniable fact, is that this game gets sweeter as time goes on. With monumental quests such as The Second Dream and The War Within, this game will blow you out of your socks. Though, for some, this can take up to 100-200 hours to get to. It\\'s crazy, but gives you the best feeling and memory afterwards.\\nYour Space Mom. Every Tenno needs to feel like they have someone..

Try looking up \"This is What You Are - Keith\" <- It\\'ll bring you to a Warframe song that is too good..\\nThe grind can be unrelenting for some. For people like me, the grind was never bad because of my constant progression, but for people who aren\\'t patient or want things quickly (in a progression system) this might be a bit too much.\\nThe lore is very hidden. There is a story, but for some major lore, and theories on it, you\\'ll have to look it up on YouTube. If you\\'d like a good series I recommend StallorD\\nThe enemy scaling. For some people who love a hard challenge, the enemy scaling might be too much. Not exactly the ENEMY itself, but more specifically the ARMOUR on an enemy. It can be insane to even damage an enemy after level 100.  \\nDojo improvements. I think Tennogen should be introduced for the Dojo, more decorations should be added, AND massive group builds. I\\'m talking about decorations that require a load of resources. That way if you have a large and active clan, you\\'ll have special things that show your true power, and riches!\\nOn \\'Finisher\\' animations for the Nikana backslash, a mark/bodysplit hould happen. What I mean is that you do a diagonal slash across the enemies back, yet no deep cut appears, or body splitting? I dunno, just a request!\\nPlease add a flashlight we can toggle. Especially with the release of PoE, seeing in the dark is crucial. Either an option to turn on and off the flashlight manually or nightvision would be greatly appreciated. I don\\'t know about anyone else but seeing in the dark hurts my eyes sometimes, oopsie!\\nNow please, note that this is all speculation and pure opinions! I love Warframe!

       " 'There are very few games that have held my attention for 1,000+ hours over the years, this is one of them. I created an account back when the game was still in Alpha (late 2012), back then it was was just a simple module with some enemies to kill with a handful of warframes to choose from. Even then though it showed promise. Over time they have added tons of content, new warframes, weapons galore, new planets, mission types, Archwing (fly in space!), events, clan dojos and foundry, player to player trading system, syndicates to join, player HUBs (relay stations), PVP, 8 player Raid etc etc. If you enjoy third person shooters, 4 player coop, pvp, raiding, RPG\\'s and/or ninjas in space (lol) this game is a dream come true then for you. Being that it is free to play there is literally nothing to lose checking it out. \\nThe game is a constant work in progress and the developer Digital Extremes (DE) is constantly tweaking and adding new content all the time. Warframe has a very decent crafting system and you will most likely find yourself trying many different warframes/weapons combinations to see which one(s) fit your style the best. Believe me the game encourages you to do so, it is surprising the amount of variety in the game. When you find something you like it is a rewarding feeling and you will too it is just a matter of time. Also decent customization for your warframes, weapons, Sentinels (companion), Kubrows (dog companion), Liset (your ship), with a multitude of color choices, skins and attachments.\\nEvery Warframe has its own set of individual abilities, they all have a total of 4. Some are better at being tanky, dps, sneaking (cloaking), solo play, healers, AOE damage, defense etc. There is a Warframe for every situation it seems. You can also make your own builds for each frame based on what mods you have (you attain them while playing missions they are dropped by enemies) For example \"Continuity\" mod allows for longer power duration time, when you ability is activated. More ammo, damage mods etc etc sooooo many. Making building your perfect Warframe/weapons very flexible and enjoyable. You have the opportunity to have a Primary, secondary and melee weapon. With the opportunity to make your own builds for everything here adds to the games replayability imo. Same goes for sentinels and kubrow companions they all have their own set of mods, especially made for them.\\nThat being said the game can be very grindy, especially for newer players. That is to be expected though being that it is an MMOish experience. Especially to gather enough resources and credits to craft your items. Well worth it though if you have the time to invest. Sometimes they seem to nerf warframes and weapons for no reason at all and then they rework it again and \"fix\" it. Nerf/Un-nerf is the nature of free to play MMO\\' ish kind of games. (Constant \"balance\" tweaking) This is not an instant gratification game either, the game gets better the more you play it. You can also purchase items with real money from the in game market, it is \\n necessary though. Most things can be attained just playing the game gathering resources and crafting them accordingly. Except, of course vanity items, skins, unique color palettes and limited time only items that have been available over the course of the game. \\nDE sometimes gifts players new color palettes and send them to your inbox (valentine\\'s day, halloween, St. Patrick\\'s day etc.) Free weapons too, they seem to do somethings special on the games anniversary every year. The developer also listens to community feedback and designs and have added many things based on that. Which is always a plus. The game can also get repetitive at times, but with the amount of content in game now that is harder to happen. You just have to mix it up from time to time and try new things within the game. \\nAll in all the future looks bright for this game. A Developer that actually listens to community feedback. Constant updates/hotfixes. Plus there is so much new content coming soon! Game is not perfect of course, but what game truly is right. There is a lot to enjoy here and unique setting and premise to the game, definitely sets itself apart from the competition.\\nMMO\\'s are hard to review, but at its current state I give this game a 4 stars ( ★ ★ ★ ★ ) out of 5',\n",
       " 'This game is evil.\\nAt first, you will be astonished by the super cool graphics and character/weapon designs. You will say to yourself \"How can this be free?\" And for the first 20 or so hours, everything will seem fine. But then, all of a sudden, you will match up with someone who has a way cooler frame than you, and you will look in awe at them, and every cell in your body will tell you \"You need to become that guy\". But then after doing some research online, you will realise that his frame is no longer obtainable, so you have to trade with some dude, who has dedicated atleast 1000+ hours to this dark ritual of a game. So, gullible as you are, you will start to slowly farm rare items, to gain enough premium currency to be able to afford this \"Frost Prime\". Then, after 20-25 hours of grinding, you will start to question your own exsistence, as you have only garned about a third of the platinum you need to buy that goddamn warframe. And then, in your hour of darkness, the game will hit you with a 50% discount on the premium currency. And in this hour of darkness, where all your mental defenses have been stripped away from the countless hours of relic farming, you will succumb to the dark lords. But not only will you buy enough platinum to afford the warframe of your dreams, you will buy one of the most expensive bundles, As the dark lords, known only in the common tounge as Digital Extremes, had intended.

I turned back to go to our campfire, but red words of death appeared. Jigger Jaw had been killed by a Level 80 dino. Gasping, I ran back to camp to find him. His remains were nowhere to be found, along with his killer. I messaged him asking if he was around, but got no answer. He had left. Later I found his murderer around the beach, and knew I was not yet ready to face this foe. But I was ready to survive. For Jigger Jaw had taught me how to survive. How to live.\\n1000/10, friendships made',\n",
       " 'At the time I write this, I have put about 3500 hours into this game. I have been playing it for over a year now and have had a lot of ups and downs. I play on a PvP server and I have had everything I had taken from me and all my tames killed many times. I have worked my way back up over and over and have managed to secure my tribe as a beta tribe on a server and am in an alliance with the alpha tribe.\\nThen Wild Card dropped Scortched Earth and the ability to transfer players and items into the server I play on. My server did everything we could to protect ourselves and it paid off. Then Wild Card made all the supply drops not effected by structures so they would still drop. So, we blocked them all off with vaults. Now Wild Card made it so the drops land on top of anything under them. We don\\'t have any defense against that.\\nWhy are we worried? Because for the better part of the last year, many servers have been taken over completely my mega tribes. Tribes that regularly hit server cap with who plays on the server. Who farm servers of all their resources and have been unchecked because no one could farm enough resources to fight them on their own servers. Now that they can travel from server to server, they are slowly working their way through all official servers and wiping the servers of everything.\\nFor people like myself who have dumped litterally thousands of hours into this game, we are doing all we can to defend, but we can only do so much as we can\\'t be online all day everyday. With the servers not being region locked, we have Chinese, Russian, and Australian tribes coming to our server during peak times for them, but the early morning hours for us. Meaning, we have no one on to defend what we worked hard to make. We now have to work in shifts, like it is a job, to defend what we have, all because Wild Card decided to open the arks up and have the players wipe the servers for them.\\nWhen a large server falls, most of the players quit playing the game. They move onto something else. That is good for Wild Card, because then the servers become low population, so they can repurpose them or remove them and that saves them a lot of money. They already made all they will make off of the players currently playing. So, if they remove us, they can save on server costs and use that for more advertising to get more unsuspecting players into the game.\\nOverall, Wild Card doesn\\'t listen to their players unless those players are praising how great the game is. The players that riducule the game, are ignored or banned due to rule violations. Wild Card doesn\\'t know what they are doing in terms of making a game that isn\\'t completely broken nor do they know how to have a conversation with their player base that isn\\'t just the positive things about the game. They refuse to hear or even acknowledge there is anything wrong with their game and that is a huge problem.\\nBottom line, only get this game if you\\'re going to play on unofficial servers or you like logging in and finding that everything you have is gone, yet again, and you get to punch a tree and start over.\\nADDED February 02, 2017:\\nI mainly talked about the PvP on Official servers in the review above, so I am adding the other ways to play the game here to hopefully give a more well rounded review.\\nSingle Player is nice as well, but nothing is persistant. So you need to increase a lot of rates in single player to make it fun. Like, at stock, if taming something takes 6 hours, you need to be logged into the game for 6 hours to tame it. If you exit, that timer pauses. Breeding anything becomes too cumbersome without increasing rates because 4 real life days that pauses when you exit the day is just not possible. Unless you want it taking 2 weeks to raise one thing. I just use single player as a \"creative mode\" to spawn everything in and build to see what I would need for the server I actually play on.\\nPvE is enjoyable but frustrating in a different way. You can\\'t build near others and as long as you close your doors, no one can take your things. People can annoy you and get in your way and just be asshats to you, and you can\\'t do anything to them because you can\\'t fight them. They can build walls around your base at the build limit so you can\\'t get out or in. It\\'s like the 12 year olds at malls that will be annoying little ♥♥♥♥♥ and and when you tell them to quit being ♥♥♥♥♥, they try to egg you on by telling you that you can\\'t do anything because they are a minor and you can\\'t hit them. Just really disrespectful. In some cases it\\'s worse than PvP.\\nThe unofficial servers are nice as it\\'s less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and more good players. Though, then you run the risk of the admins of the servers spawning in whatever they want and wiping the server anytime without notice. So, you could log in and the whole server is wiped and you lost everything. They could change up the mods on the server without notice and just shut the server down because they didn\\'t want to pay for it anymore. If you\\'re playing PvP on their server and you wipe them and become alpha, they can just delete everything you have, rollback the server to before you wiped them, spawn in a level 1million titanosaur and smash everything you have, or any combination of those.\\nMy biggest gripe with the game is that it\\'s not fun anymore. It was fun for the last year and with the last few months of updates, it\\'s just not fun anymore. You can have a lot of fun on unofficial servers, but they are also very volatile as well. Maybe more so than PvP official servers. The way I see it, is that if you never played this game before and you join a server, you should have fun right away. You shouldn\\'t have to join unofficial servers and add mods to the game to make it fun. To me, that says the developers failed at their job for making a fun game. Sure, int he future, you might get bored of the offical servers and mod the game to get some NEW excitement out of it, but you shouldn\\'t have to mod a game after you bought it in order to get fun from it.\\nIf Wild Card wants to keep all transfers open the way they have it now when you can transfer creatures, players, and items from server to server, then I suggest they do a full wipe of every server so everyone has a fair start to build up. Otherwise the mega tribes that basically own official servers have so much unchecked power to just wipe servers and take all their resources and get even bigger. There isn\\'t any hope to fight them off.\\nBut, if Wild Card just limits you transferring your character, that would be better as then you need to build up on a server. I have seen a few smaller tribes band together and wipe alphas that are just mean and ruin your day for fun. It happened on my server last year. The alpha we have now is friendly and helps the server anytime they can and uses their power to defend the server against attacks.\\nEDIT: I haven\\'t edited anything on this review. I just wanted to add that I replied in the comments to reply to the comments I received about this review.\\nEDIT 2: I still haven\\'t changed my initial review, just wanted to add two things that I know no one will read.\\n1. In my comments below that are back pages at this point, I made a typo regarding my family. I said they were all dead, I meant to say they were all dead to me. They are all alive, but very toxic, hateful people and I don\\'t talk to them unless I absolutely need to.\\n2. Since I posted this, I keep getting friend request from people. I\\'m denying every single one of them because I\\'m just assuming you are all trolls going to harrass me or come to my server and wipe it. Though, that would speed up the process of me quitting the game as I wouldn\\'t have anything left to go back to.\\nEDIT 3: I added into the main review about the other game modes so people would stop commenting about them. But, none of them will actually read the review and just call me names and say I don\\'t have a life. Which says a lot about them.',\n",

       " \"After many have tried, Studio Wildcards and associate dev-studios are trying to finally deliver us what we have all been craving for: A survival game with dinosaurs! ARK: Survival Evolved is pretty much exactly that, with an added twist of some unexplained sci-fi elements that all tie surprisingly well into the game. But is this Early Access title worth your money and time? Can we trust anyone after the Stomping Lands disaster?\\nARK puts you in the shoes of a half-naked guy (or gal), stranded on the eponymous ARK, the island the game takes place on. You do get the option to customise your character, although like in many other games, anything but the smack center for most sliders ends up looking ridiculous (hugely muscled, giraffe-necked dwarf or super tall, onyx-skinned valkyrie?), but it is still nice to have the option to go down that path. It should be noted at this point that your characters will be server-specific, meaning you can have one on every server. \\nYour character will start the game with nothing to his or her name, true to the survival-game code. You will quickly learn the ways of a hunter-gatherer, as your first task will usually be picking berries and collecting stones. You can also punch trees to get wood, but doing so will damage you (a dig at Minecraft? I like to think so.). \\nEven at this early point, the world of ARK does not try to hide its inhabitants from you. Huge, prehistoric beasts roam free over most of the map and there is rarely ever a moment during which you cannot see at least one dinosaur from your location. Not all of these creatures are trying to kill you, however, some just try to live their life in peace. They may even fight each other, as the predators hunt for prey and the latter defends itself. \\nPlayers should quickly realise that most of the island's monsters are beyond their combat-capabilities and that they should steer clear of the particularly agressive ones dwelling on land, in the sea and even the air. To help the players deal with these threats and offer some sense of progression at the same time, ARK features a levelling-system. You gain XP at a steady rate over time, with a bonus for doing pretty much anything from gathering and killing to crafting and building. Levelling up will allow you to increase one of your attributes, as well as spend points learning a new crafting-blueprint. While you are barely able to craft torches and stone tools at the beginning of your adventure, later down the line you may pick up the recipes for weapons, buildings and more tools to help you survive. All blueprints cannot be unlocked until a very high level, so specialising in a select few while working together with other players online can be a huge benefit. \\nThe unwritten goal in ARK, for most players, is to build a somewhat self-sufficient base for yourself and your tribe. Bases are built using a very simple and easy to understand system of square foundations with snapping walls on their four sides and flat roofs on top. Indeed, whoever has played Rust will immediately feel at home, as the whole game plays very much like it. This includes player's characters falling asleep and remaining in the world whenever their pupeteer disconnects, adding additional treat to potential raiders, who will be able to take all of your character's belongings even when you are not on the server. Of course, building a secure base will help combat this threat. \\nWhat sets ARK apart from Rust is its setting (frigging dinosaurs), its general artstyle (sci-fi-looking HUD and inventory/character screen), its graphics (looking seriously impressive) and the fact that you can tame your very own dinos! Instead of killing the giant murder-machines (or players), you can choose to knock them unconscious instead, beginning a rather lengthy taming-process during which you must keep the creature subdued while also feeding it its favoured food. Eventually, it will become your (and your tribe's) companion, able to aid you in combat, bear your burdens and even be ridden as a personal mount (works with flying dinos, too!). What more needs to be said, really.\\nYes of course, the game has had a rather shaky launch into Early Access. According to the devs, they did not expect such a large resonance initially, which caused most official servers to crack under the pressure and lag. Also, the stunning graphics of ARK come at a price: Your hardware will suffer. At this point in time, you need a fairly beefy machine to be able to play ARK at a reasonable framerate. The devs are aware of this and are currently working on optimising the game to maximise FPS and minimise lag. \\nAll of this was to be expected, really and is in no way reason to give ARK a negative review. In fact, the devs claim one of the reasons for the current performance-issues to be their initial focus on content, wanting to give players enough things to do ingame for Early Access, which I think speaks volumes about the good intentions behind this project. \\nIndeed, even for Early Access ARK offers a great deal of content and longevity through its progression-system and dinotaming-mechanics, with so much more planned for the future. The performance-issues are being tackled at the time of me writing this review and some first patches have already been rolled out, resulting in some great improvements for a lot of the players. I am very much looking forward to see more stuff added to ARK: Survival Evolved and I believe the very pleasant developers have the right ideas on how to steer it to success.\",\n",
       " 'First off. I know people are going to read this and go \"You have 1.5k HOURS IN THIS GAME HOW CAN YOU GIVE IT A NEGATIVE REVIEW?\"\\nEasy. I\\'ve played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. I love it. I split the time playing it between myself and a family member. Interacting with dinosaurs? Amazing. Building a base? Amazing. The overall concept of the game? Amazing. \\nThe difficulty? There are so many times in this game where something stupid happens and it literally has a domino effect on everything else. It\\'s immersive. You take ONE moment for granted while you\\'re mining, or picking some berries and out of NO WHERE you\\'ll get bum rushed by a large dinosaur who\\'s hungry and wants YOU and your TAMED animal for dinner. Within moments the flying mount you\\'ve spent HOURS taming can be gone. It\\'s infuriating. You get so mad, and then you go back, and you rebuild. You go find another dinosaur to tame. YOU won\\'t get beat by the game. Even at higher levels it\\'s difficult. It\\'s unforgiving, and for that I appreciate the game itself.\\nWhy can\\'t I recommend this game? It\\'s broken. I\\'ve been playing since Alpha and there are STILL snapping issues with buildings. You have structures that have clipping issues and make it difficult building things next to each other. You know minor things that can be fixed relatively easily that have just been overlooked.\\nSome of the dinosaurs are incredibly unbalanced. MicroRaptors  are hands down the worst thing ever introduced to this game. You literally have no way to combat them and they often come out of no where and are found near numerous other dinosaurs that have no issue taking a nibble out of you and your mount while you\\'re stun locked for 10 seconds. It\\'s hard enough being knocked off of your mount. This is just one of the examples I can give as far as how over powered some of the dinosaurs abilities are.\\nConstant bugs. This game had NO business exiting early access. I can honestly say that. Every single time you roll out a patch you\\'re breaking something within the game. It doesn\\'t necessarily have to be a large patch like the recent one with aberration. Often times it\\'s small little patches that cripple the game system to the point where it\\'s unplayable. I recall a patch not long ago where anytime you went to harvest stone the game would just hard crash each and ever single time. \\nStuff like this shouldn\\'t be happening to a game that\\'s out of Early Access. \\nQuite simply. This game was not ready for a full release. It still is not ready for a full release. You shouldn\\'t have game breaking bugs every single time you release a patch. A proper game that is ready for release is Polished. It functions. This game does not fit either of those criteria. It\\'s understandable to have SOME issues with each major patch, and we appreciate how often Wildcard releases patches and adds things to this game, but this game is still by all means an Early Access title. \\nFor that reason, and that reason alone. I cannot recommend that others buy this game. Not until Wildcard fixes some of the glaring stability issues that it has.',\n",
       " 'tl;dr — worth it, loved it, but I\\'m not very hardcore. 300 hours on record, 100+ of those with my kids. \\nAnd now, STORYTIME: \\nI love playing co-op games with my kids. When I looked at \\n (currently in Early Access on Steam) it looked like just such a thing. When I dug into it and learned that I could host a LAN server in my house, and edit The Island to be a bit less deadly and a bit more generous, went all in with my sons.\\n \\nBefore long I had all four of my kids playing with me, and each other.\\n \\nCurrently my girls are the heavy hitters, training mobs of small dinosaurs, and then marching them into harm\\'s way. The game\\'s A.I. spawns some tough beasts, but short of the epic boss battles (which we have not bothered with), and the Alpha T-Rex (which we haven\\'t run into), nothing stands for long against Keliana\\'s swarm of dilophosaurs and dimorphodons, or Gleek\\'s hopping mob of giant frogs.\\n \\nKeliana and I did run into a bit of trouble with our expedition from the north-east river mouth, but that wasn\\'t her fault. I shall now tell you about it.\\n \\nWe  attempted to bring 24 tamed dinos and one tricked-out crafting raft southwest through narrows and swamps. We discovered, after it was too late to turn around, that the size of our mob and the size of our raft made the trip extremely tedious. It didn\\'t get dangerous until I got fed up and decided on a side trip.\\n \\nMy plan was simple. Ride Terry, my pteranodon who kept fouling the raft\\'s travel, from our mob\\'s location at the western edge of the Eastern Plains, east and south to a platform we\\'d been building in the middle of the Eastern Forest. There he\\'d be high, dry, and safe. I would then parachute back, timing my glide to get me most of the way to safety. It\\'s a high platform, and I\\'d seen my son make that kind of glide before.\\n \\n(Note: The logic that goes \"I saw my son do a thing in a game so it is a thing I can now do\" has never gotten me into trouble before, I swear.)\\n \\nA dimorphodon named Zed was following me and Terry. Unfortunately, Zed fell behind, and I forgot he was there. I landed Terry safely, lined up my jump, and leapt back the way we\\'d come. My chute popped perfectly, and my glide was going to be LONG. Then Zed caught up, flew straight at me, and fouled the lines of my chute.\\n \\nI dropped fast. Not killed-by-the-fall fast, but definitely short-of-my-goal-by-80% fast. I landed in a boulder-filled vale just to the west of the platform. The vale\\'s only other major feature besides boulders was hungry carnivores. I emptied my shotgun into a \\'raptor, then finished it off with a pike only to discover that a carnotaur had stopped quarreling with a pair of sabertooths, and was charging me.\\n \\nCarnos charge in straight lines, and turn poorly. I used the terrain to my advantage, and attempted to lead him back into his sabertoothed foes. It worked perfectly, except for the part where they decided to share a meal. I now had three carnivores chasing me.  I almost ran headlong into another sabertooth, but it leaped and I ducked, and then I kept running.\\n \\n\"Keliana, where are you?\"\\n \\n\"North of that purple light. There\\'s a cliff between me and you. You\\'ll need to go around it.\"\\n \\nI turned and checked to see how close pursuit was.\\n \\nI screamed.\\n \\nThe game does a really good job of getting predators right. They don\\'t roar or screech unless they\\'re fighting. They come at you teeth-first, and quietly.\\n \\nI had a perfect view of three sabertooths, one carnotaur, and behind them, just starting to take interest, a pair of tyrannosaurs who I may have run a bit too close to without noticing them.\\n \\n\"THERE IS NO AROUND!\"\\n \\nThe nice thing about video-game cliffs is that if they\\'re not sheer, sometimes you can cheat them, running sideways and down, and landing without having broken your bones. I did this, knowing that my pursuit could do the same thing.\\n \\nI splashed through shallows at the base of the cliffs, and then saw that I was being charged from the front by a velociraptor. It was over.\\n \\nThen I saw that the velociraptor had a saddle on it, and there was a woman in the saddle.\\n \\n\"I\\'ve got you, Dad!\"\\n \\nShe and the mob swept past me. I missed what happened next, because it happened behind me. I did get game alerts telling me that my tribe\\'s pets were killing things, but they went by too fast for me to count. I saw exactly zero flashing red alerts, which meant that Keliana had killed everything chasing me without taking any casualties.\\n \\nThat\\'s my girl.\\n \\nAre we playing this game the way it was meant to be played? If the online PVP tournaments are any indication, we\\'re doing it all wrong.\\n \\n \\nWrong is fine.',\n",

It's like a mix of Jurassic Park and Minecraft with a touch of DayZ.

       " 'OK, I previously reviewed this before they announced an actual launch date.  I still stand by my initial review.  We played for over a year on an incredible community server.  There was still PVP but it wasn\\'t what the PVP has turned into.  You want these big wars they advertise with you riding armies across fields to PVP.  Keep looking for a different game because you will never see that in this game.  We initially had uninstalled due to how toxic the player base got after cross server transfers.  We saw the new Isolated servers and thought wow, finally a way for people to enjoy the game.  My husband played for a day on one server before being trolled and losing everything while offline.  He started over on a new server and I joined him because everyone he was running into wasn\\'t about just ruining his game. A few hours later we had a small house and a few riding tames.  I had just placed a feeding trough finally and was heading to my house to park and log off.  All of the sudden a guy on a raptor and a guy on a frog show up trying to kill me, so I get away becuase obviously after a few hours we have no defenses so I run. They proceed to blow a hole in the building I come back to ask why to which they then just keep me unconcious while they dump, not take my things just dump on the ground our entire morning of work.  Player base in this game is toxic, you can\\'t enjoy it, you can\\'t build, you can\\'t tame because someone will just come along in a few hours and destroy it all again.  I stick with my initial review.  Do not waste your money!  Game is still super laggy, even on extremely low memory it overheats our pc\\'s Some parts of maps are so glitchy you can barely make it through them.  It had the potential to be a great game but the humans playing it ruin any fun anyone gets. There is no need to attack people that have only played a few hours, have no turrets, live in stone and don\\'t even have a dino that can eat other dinos.  That is just being a♥♥♥♥♥♥  That is what this game is full of.  If no one lets anyone build you can never have true PVP because OP players picking on new players is not PVP.  Add to that the fact that for the most part developers didn\\'t listen to any of us when they made changes that affected gameplay, I mean why would you listen to the player base, what would they know about how your game actually plays.  Now a once awesome game was destroyed from the inside out.  Bad decision after bad decision and now they try to \"fix\" what they broke but the players are entirely too toxic to fix.  Players have found every way possible to exploit the game and find new ways to every day.  Maybe it\\'s not just this game maybe it\\'s just a sign of society in general.  I have noticed a change in the gamers out there no empathy, they cheat whenever they can, it\\'s all me, me, me with most of them.  Time to go back to the way life used to be actually interracting with humans so you can actually see the pain in someone when you crush their soul.  Maybe it wouldn\\'t be as easy to be such nasty cheating trolls in every game.  What\\'s the point of a PVP game if you never let anyone build so they are actually a fight?  Oh I guess you aren\\'t good enough to actually PVP so just keep trolling we\\'ll go elsewhere and tell our friends not bother.

Expanded locations allowed us more resources and dinos, while also allowing fast travel locations.\\nThen you get big tribes trying to police the world.\\n My final straw was realizing a group of four, could never take on a group of 15. I tried diplomacy, but realized, why the f*** am i going to these lengths for some Dbag i don't even know?\\nI burned out on the diplomatic, and relations part of the game in pvp. Its too much of a pain to maintain those relationships constantly.\\nIf you're new, go pve to learn the basics. If you want to try you're luck at pvp, i'm all for it, its fun. Until you have to deal with people who have all the power on a server, because they have more numbers.\",\n",
       " \"This is one of the best survival games I have ever played and it's only in early access right now. There is already a ton of content and the game looks beautiful. There are a few bugs here and there and the game still needs to be optimized for better performance (Devs said this is in progress already) but right out of the gates, this game is amazing.\\nThere currently is no tutorial for what to do or how to progress but it's a survival game so it's fun to learn the hard way, especially when the hard way means getting your body gnawed on by dinosaurs. When you first join the game you are welcomed by a character creation screen. You can choose either Male or Female and then customize your look. The customization is a little sparse at the moment with some awkward scale adjustments for the body. After fiddling around with it for a while, I just ended up going with something very close to the default look.\\nOnce you create your character and choose one of 4 general areas to spawn (North/South/East/West) you find yourself waking up on a beach and scratching your arm that has some weird implant in it. This implant seems to be the key to how you manage your inventory, crafting, and leveling up. The first thing you will notice when you start on your beach is just how good this game looks and it is truly beautiful. The sun is beating down onto the beach where the water meets the sand. The trees in the richly detailed forest sway in the wind and the grass and foliage cover the landscape before you. So much vibrant life all around you and then you see the dinosaurs. \\nThe dinosaurs are very detailed and bring a since of awe to the game just like the first scene you see in Jurassic Park. Luckily you see mostly herbivores but do be careful because there are some small carnivores you can run into on the beach as well. It seems that the most dangerous wildlife can be found more inland. That isn’t to say that these herbivores are pushovers. That triceratops or giant turtle will most likely kill at this point in the game, so don’t attack them just yet. \\nYou begin your hard life of survival punching some trees and picking up rocks until you can craft your first pickaxe and move on from there. You can collect berries and fibers from the plant life, bash giant boulders to smithereens, and chop down any tree. You will need all of these materials to craft better items, starting with some clothes to cover up your nakedness.  \\nThis brings us to experience. You gain experience throughout the game from doing any action. Collecting materials, crafting, and combat all add to your experience pool. If you are in a tribe you gain bonus xp from your tribe mates. Once you level up you get to choose one stat to increase permanently (health, stamina, attack, weight, etc…) and then you earn some engram points to use towards learning new items to craft. The more you level, the stronger you get and the more you learn to craft. So far this is the only way to learn recipes for crafting.\\nThis is a survival game as well so you have to keep an eye on your overall health. You can’t let yourself get too hot or cold, clothes, fire, and water help with this. You can’t let yourself starve so you need to forage for berries and hunt the wildlife. With eating comes defecating so make yourself regularly take a dump or your character will just act like a horse and take it anywhere they please. Actions require stamina and your character will tire if the stamina is depleted. You need to stay hydrated as well so go dunk your head in some water or craft a flask. If you take an excessive blow or fall from too high you will break a bone and walk at a snail’s pace so do be careful.\\nYou can hunt the dinosaurs in this game but you can also tame and even ride some of them. This process can be long depending on the dinosaur you wish to tame so be prepared before you do so. You basically either punch or shoot them with sling shots/arrows until they get knocked unconscious. Once unconscious you need to load them up with their respective food type (berries for herbivores, meat for carnivores). Make sure you have narco berries to feed them as well so that they can stay under for the entire time it takes. Some dinosaurs take a single in game day to tame while others can take multiple days. It is always easier to tame a dinosaur with a group of friends. If you have learned the ability to craft that dinos saddle, then you can also ride them to your heart’s content.\\nThis also brings us to the multiplayer interaction. This is a survival game so banding together with others increases your odds of survival. You also have to be weary of those who don’t have your welfare in mind and are only looking out for themselves. If you can band together you can create your own tribal town with dino protectors and likeminded players. This will also protect you from those looking to do harm. When you log out of the game your character goes to sleep and is vulnerable. If you have friends and tamed dinos, this makes it safer to log out when you are done. \\nThere is so much to this game and it is only in early access. The devs have promised a plethora of more content to come and I am looking forward to all of it. For now I will try and do my best to survive this harsh world. My next goal is to tame a raptor and ride him/her… if it doesn’t kill me first…\",\n",
       " 'I played a few hours of this game so i figured i might do a review.\\nIt was a great game for a while, then the chinese found the game and loved it. however organized groups of trolls and griefers decided to \"make war\" on many of the servers. the developers taking a hands off approach did nothing about it.\\nmany servers were ruined and the player base left in droves.\\nI went from server to server, sometimes fighting back, sometimes hiding. always in the end I was pushed to breaking point. I would make gains in the daytime and by night my stuff would be attacked.\\nI stayed up at odd hours to defend my property, eventually I was ground down and killed.\\nI went through 4 public PVP servers when the chinese invasion first hit. lost several tribes of good people who one by one fell apart under the pressure to keep things running.\\nIn that respect I feel the developers failed me as a player. they took a hands off approach and forever scarred my experience of the game.\\nNow my views on the game irrespective of social and dev issues:\\nPro\\'s: \\nthe game looks beautiful\\ngameplay is tight\\nsounds are good\\nAI is acceptable mostly\\nlots and lots of stuff to do\\nPVP and PVE\\nCustom servers\\nMOOOODS!\\nCon\\'s:\\npublic servers are really bad and not administered\\nThere is no offline protection\\nThere is limited enjoyment to be had from PVE as 3/4 of stuff is pvp oriented\\nthe game is a huge time sink\\nNow, the number one Issue i have is that, the  game caters to players who play all the time, like anyone who is a 3hr per day type person simply cannot play PVP or enjoy it. and if they do usually its on the backs of a group of people who play 11hr+ a day keeping things running and protected.\\nThis one single issue, is why the game annoys me, without offline protection, the game puts too much pressure on smaller groups forcing them to join larger groups simply to have any fun at all. this wieghting towards larger tribes basically destroys any aspirations of long term play for any group.\\nLife cycle within the game is basically.  tribes get bigger and bigger, biggest tribe rules and kills anyone who annoys them, and eventually starts killing people because they can, around that time, they usually force many smaller tribes out of the server and then eventually they break up and leave.\\nsomeone fills the power gap and it starts all over again.\\nThat being said, the game is fun, and rewarding, you can make great friends and have alot of fun. you can also subject yourself to sleepless nights. worry and lose friends over it. so its your choice how you play the game, but play it to have fun.\\n====== Post Transfers Review==========\\nSo, the developers reactivated transfering characters and dinos across servers, originally i was not a fan of this severely broken mechanic, but its grown on me over the past several months of play.\\nIt seems to have had the effect of making tribes get even bigger to keep thier servers safe from outsiders. but in the end, if someone comes to a server to wipe it. its being wiped no matter how much stuff you have or people you have. because you do not know its comming until its too late.\\nTheres definately some kinks to work out in the transfer system to allow defenders a better chance at protecting themselves from offline raids and across server invasions.\\nthe number of servers being wiped is steadily increasing as more and more tribes push out to attack old enemies.\\nLooking forwards to see how the developers change the transfer mechanic once they see how its being used.\\n===========Post Being part of a Baddass multi server alpha tribe===============\\nSo its been a few more months since transfers got activated, since then I became part of my servers alpha tribe, joined a multi server coalition of tribes for mutual defence.\\nFought off multiple tribes run by some of the biggest twitch and youtube streamers on ark official servers and generally had a bunch of fun finally getting back at some of those tribes who attacked me long ago.\\nIs ark still interesting to me?  yes and no.  while I enjoy the pvp elements of the game more and more, I no longer get a chance to just have some fun taming a dino or going out to craft and build things.\\nYou see once your tribe becomes truely huge, you just have too many bases to maintain or build, you have too many dinosaurs to look after and you have too many demands on your time from raising baby dinos to farming bullets and fuel and fertalizer to keep your defences running.\\nThe ark developers recently made certain resources be consumed faster so base maintinence is more annoying than it was. and with the impending release of the game, there are still many issues I have with the game that I would have expected to be fixed before release.\\nso Im taking a break for a while, maby after release ill do another review, hopefully things are sorted by then.\\n====================================== early post release review=======\\nLooks like many of the anti dupe protections now work, new servers, ect is cool.\\nbut... within a day everyone who was abandoned on the \"legacy servers\" came over to the new ones and took over every server which means alllll the new players basically got slaughtered and will have no chance to get anywhere thanks to power levelling.\\nsooo... i dont know... same game as before. doesnt feel released.',\n",
       " \"I would not recommend this game for ANYONE until full release, if that ever happens. I feel wronged by the new DLC and refuse to purchase something that should have been given free. I understand that it's early access and all that goes with it, but to charge for something that has been hyped for so long, and refusal to fix known issues, makes the game unworthy of recommendation for anyone considering purchasing this game.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, I recommend this game if you play on a private server or solo game. I have played over 2000 hours of this game. I love it. The art is great, the game play is great, but the public servers are not so great. \\n********************************************************\\nI do not recommend this game for public servers\\n********************************************************\\nLots of griefing in this game, especially from the players located across the Pacific Ocean. On public servers I and my tribe mates have been warding off invasions. It becomes a chore and these invaders use hacks and cheats which destroy months and even a year\\'s worth of hard work in very little time. With the re-instated server tansfer capabilities, it has gotten to the point where the game is unplayable and simply not fun. People blocking resources and not allying up is very problematic as well. Then if the invaders do take over various resources you and your tribe are hosed. The game is not balanced well for PVP, especially if the invaders have taken over other public servers, mining resources there and then transfering into your server. We\\'ve attempted blocking all the Obies and all the drops as to deter them and at the least trap them here. Unfortunately, that breaks the game play even more. \\nWithin the discussions, there are a lot of complaints about these invaders from across the Pacific. These discussions often times are \"locked\" from replies and or are deleted in order to minimize the exposure of the problem rather than providing an answer for the problem. One answer would be to follow in the steps of other studios, where these particular group of people only have access to servers listed for their country/region. I do hope this issue becomes resolved one way or another. It is sad that such a great game can be ruined by social behaviors. Unfortunately, the culture of certain countries do not view cheating as a bad thing. In fact they view it as \"a win is a win, no matter how it\\'s achieved\".',\n",
       " 'Well I have put in over 1,000 hours into this game so I don\\'t need to tell you that I enjoyed the game, but I will anyway.\\nBefore I dive into the actual game I want to talk cons. \\nThis game requires fairly constant attention if you play with other people. On Lan servers/Solo play this is not as much of an issue, but there are timers on a lot of things that will reset if you don\\'t play often enough. Buildings will be able to be destroyed/auto demolished after a certain number of days. After a set number of days pets will become claimable (this allows other players to take your pets before they starve to death), and then if left unclaimed they will starve to death. If you don\\'t have time and/or a lot of friends to play with it may be hard to keep up with the timers. Thatch houses give you 3 days, Wood gives about 7. pets are usually claimable at the time that wood buildings are allowed to be demoed (PVE) without attacking (PVP). On Private servers/solo play these can be turned off and some are automatically turned off, but in official servers they are unchanging. \\nNow on to pros. \\nI love how open this game is. I can do what I want, when I want, and wherever I want. If I want to build a castle on top of a mountian I can do just that. If I want to tame a T-Rex, or Quetzalcoatlus (giant flying reptile) I can simply set my sights on that and tame one. I would reccommend starting on an official PVE server and learning the ropes from the helpful sorts that tend to gather there before heading over to any PVP servers. If you start on a PVP for the first time don\\'t be surprised if players destroy your \"loot pinata\" (house built with easy to break materials like thatch and to a much lesser degree wood) for the easy and free items they can get out of the building. \\nKeep in mind this is a survival game. However, unlike some survival games ARK does not penalize you if you die. If you die and don\\'t find your equipment after a while your equipment will disapear, but everything else you have built will not (unless there was a giga attacking your base camp, even then you keep all of your level ups and engrams so it is a lot faster to rebuild.) Go into this game expecting to die. If you are not dying on a regular basis before you reach level 20-30 you are either lucky or have had help. Joining a tribe can help make it easier to stay alive, but is not necessary (I got my first character to level 70 with around 100 pets before I joined my first tribe). I am now on my fourth character (I got bored of demolishing everything on the island with my pet gigas on 3 of the prior 4 and 1 of them I accidentally deleted). \\nAlso keep in mind that this game is not yet complete. There will continue to be changes made to the game until it is officially released, so be warned that the game is not optimised (may run slow/not at all on mid cost computers), and there are going to be glitches and or things that break between now and completion. We are here testing the game to help them find game breaking bugs, so be sure to report any that occur. \\nThere are quite a few mods for this game, and many of them are great. I would however reccomend taming all the way up to at least a T-Rex before you start to mod the game. Some of the mods take away from the over all gameplay. \\nHope my review is helpful, and I wish any who play good luck. FYI Official PVE servers are probably the best starting locations for new players.',\n",

With every patch they add more content/bugs to a game that is already so buggy and glitchy already. FIX THE BUGS AND AI PATHING. You can't ride a land based tame without getting snagged on every little thing on the map. I've lost so many tames to these glitchy maps it's stupid. PVE is boring and ruined by the devs last patch, PVP is completely unbalanced and not real PVP at all. There is no way to defend a base on this game at all. You can try all you want but the larger tribe WILL get in.  Offensive strategies are too strong compared to the little bit of defenses available. Cross ark transfers were the first stage of the devs killing the game, the flyer nerf was the second. \\nI hope you enjoy boring farming at stupidly low rates just to watch your work be taken by somebody else while you're offline. Ark PVP servers have become toxic in a way that you can't let your kids play either.

       " 'I am convinced that the Survial game genera is a big joke on us. Its a big socilogical experiment and we are the Guinea Pigs. Most of the time this game is so much fun, but then some jerk does the equivalent of Home Invasion in real life and ruins everything. They scream and shout about PvP and so on. PvP is garbage in this game. Tribe Warfare and PvP when you and your oponent are on even ground is fun. Being lvl 65 or 100 depending what you play on, and running around picking up and dropping new spawns isnt pvp, thats pretty much just going to the newborn ward at the local hospital and punching babies. Mostly its high level people and large Tribes wiping out smaller ones for some weird reason.  Alot of the interactions that go on in game are mostly people whom are very \"small\" in real life, who are a bit to big for their britches in game. (Yeah I said Britches,,whats up ?)   One of my first encounters with the lower lifeforms in this game was as I was taming a dino with  some tribe members, two people came up to us and accused us of stealing something. We didnt, and we told them that. They decided anyways to Tranq me and when I dare voice my displeasure over it, the female aggressor killed me, and said that I should be nice..... I called her a scumbag.  Oh well life goes on.\\nAnyways whole point being this game will pretty much let you live out your sociopathic fantasys of murdering people for nothing, and more than likely be stabbed to death in a dark jungle by a 15 year old.  Mostly this game is just an excuse to act crappy toward people with no reprocussions.\\nBUT :PvP can be great when things are relativly fair. Rideing dinosaurs is great, EVERYTHING about this game is awesome. EXCEPT other people, who mostly spend time griefing. Find a good server. Find a group of people, not just 1-4 guys. I mean like 15-20 people. Then the game will really shine.\\nAlso to the Toxic comments I keep Deleteing, IDGAF about you thoughts feelings or opinions. Go write your own review.

       " \"It's been over two years and 3000 hours since I first started to play ARK.  I've seen the good, and the bad, and the what the hell.  I've seen the angry folks who can't forgive any misstep, the people who bend over backwards to defend the developer, and everyone in between that just wants to play the damned game.  It's hard to talk about the game without talking about the development cycle so here's the preamble: This was an Early Access game.  It had a checkered past of being filled chock full of bugs (falling through the map when logged out, for example), running at least a year longer in development time than intended, and putting out a paid DLC expansion while still in development.  These are all things that have happened.\\nNow, with that out of the way, yes, I recommend ARK.  With caveats.  \\nQuite a few, actually.\\nYou see, what first got me here, and might be getting you here, is the notion of taming dinosaurs.  And let me tell you, I still love riding a rex and eating things.  I love having a grouping of dinos that are just . . . mine.  I grew up loving dinosaurs.  I still love them.  What kept me here is that plus building.  I love building.  It's fun to make things, giant things, pretty things, fantastic things. But, what enables these things in a way that makes them enjoyable are (A) mods.  Lots of mods.  (B) an unofficial server (C) reasonable people to play with, regardless of PvE or PvP.\\nLet's hit up the main game experience first.  You load into your chosen world, and are prompted to create your version of a dude or a lady, then, when finished, you spawn in, naked but for some undies laying somewhere on a beach or the jungle.  And then, almost immediately after, you are eaten.  You may or may not even see your attacker.  You spawn again.  This time, you get a good look around (and almost assuredly turn down your graphical settings; the game has been optimized but it's still overly demanding) and you get to see the raptor running at you before being attacked by the rest of the raptors following that one, and boom, dead again.  You spawn in a third time and, assuming you aren't on a PvP server where griefers reign, you will live.  You see a few wandering creatures, and you start picking berries from bushes so you don't starve.  Hitting trees for thatch. Picking up stones from the ground.  Now you have a stone pick, a building plan you start with, and you can start to harvest rocks.  And then a dilophosaurus spits on you, blinding you while it eats you.  You spawn in again, and once again are naked and tool-less.  You can now choose: run to your corpse to retrieve your belongings, or start anew.  Here's what you'll keep if you die: your experience, and your “engrams” building plans that you have personally memorized.  Anything and everything else can be lost.  Dinosaurs, buildings, items, anything.  If you're on PvP, the you ARE setting yourself up for potentially losing hours to days to even months of work in the possible blink of an eye.  On PvE, you only lose the items on you when you die, your dinosaurs to other dinosaurs, or structures to rampaging beasts that detect you or a tamed dino, which they apparently find super interesting and immediately tasty, and they will chew through your house to get to the meaty treat inside.  That means a sufficient wall will keep those out.  There are ways to safeguard, but the potential for loss is always there.\\nNow, on to the points. There are free official map “mods”, and the best of those, visually, is one called Ragnarok.  The original Island is fine for starting out on, but Ragnarok has a bit of everything, including a smattering of most of the things from Scorched Earth, the DLC expansion they released during development.  There are also building and decoration mods, Structures + being the most well known, so well known that Wildcard themselves have decided to implement features of that mod into the base game; it includes a variety of quality of life features that allow for easier building as well as automation of some of the more tedious farming and upkeep requirements.  There are decorative mods, the most robust being eco's series of mods.  There is a rather in depth building mod for medieval style building called Castles, Keeps, and Forts, which allows for a different style and look over the original materials.  There's even mods to speed along the taming times by causing hunger while simultaneously delivering torpor.  If all this seems like a lot to cover, it is, at first.  You may or may not be better off trying ARK in single player to test it out vanilla first, but sooner or later, you'll want a server, because this game isn't built nor balanced for single player.\\nWhen you pick servers, if you happen to be a masochist, I'd suggest choosing an official server, which will have default tame times and harvesting ratios and the whole thing will take you a while.  If you hate yourself, choose an offical PvP server.  Otherwise, I heartily suggest finding a friend, an acquaintance, or just picking at random and signing in to an unofficial server.  See, those servers can change taming times to be more reasonable.  There are dinosaurs that, without the super master taming food, can take upwards of 8 hours, depending on the level.  This is reasonable only if you have a tight knit group willing to take shifts to tend to the creature.  Even in PvE, a wandering meat eater of some kind can happen upon the unconscious dinosaur and ruin the tame.  It can be even harder/worse with “passive” tames, where you toss it food and then wait as it wanders, possibly coming in contact with all manner of dangerous creatures.  A server with altered stats for taming, harvesting, breeding, and more is in my opinion a must for full enjoyment of the game past the mark of a week.\\nWhich I feel leads me to the last point, if you join a server where there are griefers, PvE or PvP, you're gonna have a bad time.  PvP griefing is obvious, but even worse is the PvE griefer which builds items to block spawns, and then continues to check in so their built roadblocks don't decay.  You will need to find reasonable folks, regardless of your preferred playstyle (unless that playstyle is griefer, in which case, I dunno man).\\nWith those three things taken care of, the game will be a wonderful experience.  2000 of those 3000 hours I've played have been on modded, changed stat maps in PvE, and it's why I've played as long as I have. \\nAlso, as a note, though this game has offically been launched, it is still under development.  They are revamping some of their earlier creatures, putting out new DLC, and they patch it constantly. The game as-is is over 100 gigs of information on a hard drive.  You'll need several gigs more if you want mods.  It doesn't run well on low end machines, I doubt it's ever going to be optimized for them.  Also, find an active server, otherwise you're waiting on the admin to update the server for way too long.\\nHappy hunting, and tame a rex for me, survivors.\",\n",
       " 'TL;DR: Bite the bullet and pay for a private server with your buddies if you want to have any fun.\\nIn the newest trailer for ARK, a naked man awakes on a beach with no idea what the hell is going on. Seconds later, he\\'s killed by a woman riding a raptor and wielding an AK-47 simply for the crime of existing. While this was a wonderful cinematic that was meant to promote the game positively, it incidentally showed potential players the single WORST part of the game and the reason you should avoid it entirely.\\nUnless you\\'re planning on playing on a private server with friends, which will cost you at least $15 a month, you\\'re guaranteed to only enjoy playing ARK if you get incredibly lucky. And I mean -incredibly- lucky. You may even find better luck on public servers if you have a friend who\\'s got 5,000+ hours in game and can supply you with everything to get started. I\\'ve tried no less than 24 times to start fresh on public servers, and here\\'s just a sampling of the things that\\'ve happened to me:\\n- Chased down by a three men riding Tyrannosaurs because I tried harvesting fiber on \"their beach\"\\n- Tranquilized with a scoped rifle, handcuffed, siphoned for my blood and left on a raft floating in the middle of the ocean\\n- Tamed my first dinosaur, logged off for a grand total of an hour and logged back in to find both my beloved parasaur and everything I\\'d made from cloth and wood stolen, burned to the ground, etc.\\n- Tranq\\'d (again) after I logged on, regained consciousness only to find my inventory stuffed with dinosaur poop.\\n- Had my entire box of berries and (albeit stolen) eggs raided and replaced with large dinosaur poop.\\n- Finally, and I mean FINALLY got to the point where I\\'d made a friend and we\\'d built a small base together near a waterfall off of the tundra. Left for maybe 10 minutes to tame some pterosaurs so we could fly, and returned to find the server admin astride a massive bronto smashing everything we owned because \"it was his waterfall\"\\nThe community is toxic, the game actively punishes you for logging off, and no matter how much progress you make you\\'ll NEVER be guaranteed anything besides a swift and unjust end. Think you can lock your base\\'s door and log off inside to be safe? Wrong again. Someone will just bust down the wall and drag your♥♥♥♥♥outside to execute you for the crime of not playing the game 24 hours a day. \\nI had fun ONLY when I was on a private server with friends and we took the time solely to have fun and build massive cities in the wildnerness. The game HAS potential, but even now it\\'s just sadistic garbage that punishes people for trying to play the game without some kind of helping hand on their side long before they start playing.\\nEither get a friend who\\'s lost his job because of all his ARK hours, or get your own server and never deal with the community at large. Red pill or blue pill. Which will you take? It doesn\\'t matter; one\\'s cyanide and the other\\'s a placebo that\\'ll give you diarrhea.',\n",
       " \"After 1500 hours in ark, I'm willing to give a review and it's really a word of warning. Read all the other negative reviews, they aren't exaggerating. Either give up any life you had in real life Ark to play this ark, because you can't have both. When you spend hundreds of hours farming a base and taming dinos, be prepared to spend hundreds of hours maintaining that, because if you aren't constantly growing your defenses and and watching all your assets, a zerg tribe from some far off country and server will come and wipe everything you had, and not even feel a little bad about it.  And when you go to take your favorite battle Quetz loaded with Ascendant weapons and armor to seek revenge on those block lettered tribes that killed all your passive tames you spent hundreds of hours on.... It'll despawn. With the last of your precious things. And the Developers won't help get any of it back.\\nArk is a game that you can spend 18 hours on a day, and the moment you go to sleep, someone in an opposite timezone will come and take all your things.

If you want a life, turn around and run. Play some FPS that you can turn off and walk away from and not start over again. \\nPlease read the reviews. It's a game you will hate to love.

You'll have a much more fun time, because if you play PVP, you may just log in naked on the beach with everything you own destroyed. Again, play on an unofficial with rules that you agree with. Some unofficials don't allow base leveling, or killing of passive dino's, etc. \\nYou'll want to find a tribe, because the more people you have working on a base, the stronger it will be, and the less time it will take building it. Once you get to metal tier, the sheer amount of stones you need to make a small metal building will be astonishing, so you need to work with others to accomplish goals that are out of a single players reach. \\nIf you play on a PVP server, know that at some point, you will wake up dead. It's only a matter of time before this happens. Expect it, and have a backup plan. IE: A small hidden home, preferrably metal, with supplies for retaming, rearming, retooling, etc., so that you don't have to start from a stone axe again. \\nOverall, it's an excellent experience, as long as you are OK with an EA title. You'll find bugs that will screw you over and cause you to lose tons of your time, but that's par for the course at this stage of development. \\nThere is no other survival game on the market that comes close to Ark at the moment. My playtime attests to that fact. \\nIf you pick it up, good luck on the isle! If you have questions, stop by my stream and ask away. I'm live from Morning (10 AM MST) to afternoon (3PM MST), and from evening (6-7PM MST) until late at night (1-3AM MST). On day 16 of a 30 Day streaming challenge, so 7 days a week.\",\n",
       " 'I have a hard time leaving a negative review for a game that I have put in so many hours into and have enjoyed the majority of my time playing. I have made some great friends and met some amazing players through Ark. \\nThere is a lot of content to the game, tons of dinos to tame and breed, beautiful maps to explore and build wonderful structures. \\nWhat this game lacks is a strong and compassionate customer support team.  Poor comunication or none at all, empty promises, not meeting and following through with deadlines. Ignoring legitimate issues, problems and bugs. Not acknowledging the playerbase with real ingame issues when they voice their concerns. \\nThis game is not ready for release on the 29th. There are still far too many issues that need to be solved or even addressed to ensure a smooth launch for any newcomers. \\nDespite all the bugs and in game issues what I find the most disheartening is the anouncment to the current players that will remain on servers that will not get wiped at release. They will not offer any customer support to our \"Legacy\" servers. \\n\"Important Customer Support Legacy Information\\nWhen the current servers become Legacy servers on the 29th, we will no longer offer Customer Support to these Legacy servers. All outstanding tickets to our Customer Support team will be wiped clean on launch day, and no future tickets submitted by those playing on Legacy servers will be accepted. Going forward our Customer Support team will be focused on assisting those present on the new cluster, which will not be plagued by many of the issues that occurred during the Early Access process. Unfortunately it is beyond the scope of our operation to continue to offer support on Legacy servers at this time.\"\\nIn my opinion I feel that they are just looking for the money. Instead of rewarding their long term fan base that has been with them through the beginning - no reward- no money to be made off of these people. Let\\'s go out of our way to force them the long term players to quit. They want the disposables. People who are unsure of playing this game and are willing to drop the cash of the newly increased price tag on the game. Try it out for a week and watch them fail. They will play long enough to see the game but it\\'s too late for a refund on it. They already got your money. You tried and moved onto another game. They are hoping for short term and casual gamers because you are disposable. They will get the most money out of the disposable people.  ',\n",
       " \"First Review...\\nTLDR; Don't plan on playing on an offical server and having a good time unless you have a crew of more than 20 to outplay Alpha clans.  Even then that's a stretch as some of these alpha clans span many servers and have over 200 members.  The most broke mechanic of all is the fact that I can name myself clan blablabla and rename it FyourFace and raid you, then change it back to blablabla and you will never know who killed your tames or raided your things.  Alphas do this all the time.  Offical servers are populated by either american, asian or brazil population and once one of them becomes an alpha if you are not from that nation you are a target.  Plain and simple\\nPlay on private, donate to private so they stay alive and stay away from offical server alphas.  they just troll and make up rules as they go.  Who's gonna stop them?\\nWhy spend 365 hours playing a game when an alpha clan can end you and ban you from a server in 10 minutes?  And that means all skills all levels gone in 10 minutes because they have the numbers to report you for abuse.  So you could join another server and start fresh, and the same thing could happen again.  \\nSo what's the problem?  Alpha clans and or large clans have nothing to do.  After they've tamed 12 Gigas and 15 Trex's and breed them to perfection stats what is there to do?  Might as well go stomping around and flex.  build metal letters in the hills that spell out clan names and kill people that want those resources for ingame stuff.  They are bored and you become their entertainment.  all your QQ and WTF's become their live streams and lolz.  \\nI loved the game, thought it was cool, built a base and started to tame and then....  I was raided so i built smarter and better, watched videos and tuts studied and played with building offline.  And was never raided (most raiding happens by mid teir clans that rename themselves so they don't get caught.) but no...   IRON MAIDEN the alpha clan said FU when I ask them to stop picking on small 2 man clans.   I myself was a one man clan.  365 hours playing on one sever to have IRON MAIDEN an alpha clan on many different servers with 200 some members most being  brazil, come out, blow my stuff up, knock me out and  imprison me.  What am I do to?  beg? They are more equiped and established then anyone on the server combined.   No I start spamming on global F#@* IRON MAIDEN AND EVERY SERVER THEY'RE ON.  STOP.  Think about it.  You're not getting your stuff back, they're not letting you out of your cage, your only option is to die of starvation and respawn.  At which point your base is already gone and your tames and your gear and for what?  You ask them to stop picking on small clans and they grab you!  well the global spam lasted for about 10 minutes and now I can't join the server no more.\\n  \\nSo!  you can join an alpha clan or hope to start one and troll the hell out of that server but the moment you feel trolled and decide to troll back... Ban hammer from that server.  ALPHAS have no end game other than to fake police or monitor the server how they choose.  so this game is at the mercy of whom ever is the alpha.  And you might be thinking well that's life and that's how it's supposed to be.  Let me say this Alpha clans are not alpha clans becuase they are better at the game they are alpha because they had a head start on a server and killed off anyone and kill anyone that gets close to them in supplies and basses to eliminate threat.  Legit strat?  sure.  So again if you have a large clan and want to try and troll a server then by all means i hope you enjoy the game.  Otherwise when you start building smart large or defensive you become target number one.  \\nSurvival is one thing first come first serve is another.\\nYou will get wiped if large enough, strong enough and or creative enough to become a threat at low levels by either leading a gigantor to your base, doing it themselves, or renaming the clan to wipe you so that when you look at the logs you have no clue who did it.\",\n",
       " \"After 788 hours on this game I can say I loved it until they added tek crap. After that it went down hill from there. Game is still not optimized, a lot of bugs and exploits still exist. The devs seemed to stop caring about it and switched to adding stuff that not many people care for anymore. I will say, I got my money's worth on it ,but its not the game it once was.\",\n",
       " 'TL;DR - the developers are making an absurd mockery of both this game and the entire Early Access program\\nFirst a couple of (in)sanity checks: this game was released almost two years ago. Then a little over half a year ago an expansion DLC was released, with a price tag roughly 60% of what the base game is selling for. That expansion consisted of an entirely NEW world to explore, with new dinosaurs, new technologies...basically a whole new game that just had the same engine and mostly the same rules and mechanics. And still they hide behind the Early Access program instead of admitting this game stopped being \"Early\" a long, long time ago. OK, end of rant about the absurdity of calling this an Early Access title.\\nNow to cases. Here is what the game does well (evaluating only the base game, not the paid DLC):\\n1. Great concept, survival plus team play plus dinosaurs. A wonderful way to start.\\n2. Excellent world design, in graphics, diversity, and habitability.\\n3. Very fun dinosaur taming mechanics (for the most part). \\n4. Solid building mechanics, enabling everything from rude huts to massive cliffside fortresses.\\nAll in all a nearly perfect start on creating a Game of the Century quality release. Now here is where it goes off the rails and dashes any such hopes:\\n1. A thoroughly toxic community, with absolutely no built in measures to stop the trolls and other toxic player types from actively ruining the gaming experience for virtually everyone else, even on PVE servers. Even on servers with mostly good players, and there certainly are some of those, only a few trolls and malicious players can quickly ruin things for everyone except the long-term, well established teams that have been on the server for ages, who only hold their own by measures almost as toxic to the server at large as the creeps they are defending themselves from. New players don\\'t have a prayer, of course. Example, all efforts to stop established players from gobbling up all the buildable land in sight have been utter failures, and one or two attempts actively made the problem much worse, so that new players can scarcely find a place to even build a campfire, let alone a shelfter from the beasties and then eventually a home. \\n2. An update system that has an annoyingly prevalent tendency to break things, e.g. by ejecting your tamed dinos from their pens, by teleporting killer dinos inside your premises, etc. And they run updates far too often and for far too little reason. Apparently it never occurred to the devs to save up and alpha test new changes until they are both a) known to be at least as sound as the code currently running, and b) there are enough of them to bother doing an update at all. And of course premature updates then result in multiple hotfix updates to fix the problems introduced in previous updates. It is almost as bad as Microsoft Windows, where most of the bug fixes in each new update are there to fix bugs introduced in previous updates. And yet all those updates consistently FAIL to fix any of the serious bugs, some of which have been in the game since the very beginning.\\n3. After probably hundreds of incremental updates, the devs still haven\\'t figured out how to make solid objects....solid. Dinos get stuck inside walls. Objects and players sink through floors and often the ground beneath them, becoming stuck and/or irretrievable. Tamed dinos blink out of existence entirely, only to appear minutes to hours later in places they cannot survive more than moments, like in the middle of a swamp full of hungry wild dinos...or hundreds of feet up in midair. Ravenous wild dinosaurs pass right through even giant steel walls to feast on your tamed dinos inside. Players fall out of the sky when their flying mounts suddenly become momentarily insubstantial or when the game knocks them offline because of even the briefest interruption of one\\'s connection to the game server, which is often the result of....\\n4. ....crappy and highly inconsistent server performance, with very poor optimization and almost no safeguards against lag and other connection issues.\\nPut all that together and the real problem becomes blindingly obvious: the devs are too caught up adding new content, e.g. a progression of more and more dangerous dinos, new items, harder survival modes, etc. and totally failing to finish fixing the massive flaws in the existing content to bring this game up to anything even approaching the quality level of a final release. That is why it is perpetually stuck in \"Early Access\".\\nEdited to add one final note: I neglected to mention that the single-player of this game is actually decent, though it is still pretty gimped due to much of the content being dependent on team play to either be possible or to be enjoyable. I wouldn\\'t recommend buying the game just for the single player mode, but thought it fair to point out that a few of the worst problems, like the toxic communities, bad server performance, and poor PvE implementation are not present in SP mode, and some others are mititaged.',\n",
       " 'This is how I wish the announcement of the paid DLC would have went down:\\n\"We have recently settled a lawsuit in the order of 40 million dollars that we were obligated to pay out as a result of a broken non-compete clause.  Due to this most unfortunate oversight, we are now in need of additional funds to continue development of the game.  We are reaching out to the community in the form of a paid DLC that will give backers early access to tonnes of new items, creatures, and an awesome new map!  All of which will be available for free upon final release of the game.\"\\nHad the release of the DLC gone down this way, I would have purchased the DLC without hesitation for myself, my girlfriend, and my best friend.  I can even live with the \"pay-to-win\" aspect of the DLC if it grants an advantage exclusively for Early Access.  Ideally however, there should be a way for non-dlc player to gain access to those technologies.  Something like a \"bring a tribemate\" system where as long as one person purchased the DLC, he/she is allowed to bring one or a few tribemates with them to the new area.\\nAn awesome incentive to purchasing the DLC before its contents would be available for free to all, (and besides its early access to the new content incentive), could have been tonnes and tonnes of awesome exclusive skins.

Or really unique skins for walls and fences, or pretty much anything for that matter.  I would buy all of the above!  \\n  \\nBut nope;  They had to go the way of so many developers.  When will they learn that integrity and honesty will get them so much further with their fans.  Yes, I am a fan. A huge fan.  A hugely dissapointed fan.\\n..It\\'s not too late to revert the horrid Paid DLC decisions:\\n1. Offer refunds to anyone that had purchased the DLC under the assumption that the content is permanently exclusive.\\n2. Offer an incentive not to get the refund: A tonne of exclusive skins, or whatever.\\n3. For those that choose to purchase the DLC after the changes to exclusivity are made also get tonnes of skins, just not the specific ones offered to the early DLC purchasers.\\n4. Sell skin packs.

       " 'Warframe, my go-to grinding game, is a complex and cooperative free to play third person shooter experience enhanced by an enormous sci-fi world that has been ever expanding since it’s beta in 2013. Digital Extremes have been constantly updating and polishing the game while adding new things every single month since it’s official “release”. Yes, it’s hella time consuming, but the good kind of consuming, it’s actually enjoyable and engaging.\\n \\nAs with all of my reviews, these are my own opinions and experiences; please check out other reviews too!\\n \\nWhile Warframe has a tutorial, it is not nearly sufficient enough for the insane complexity. It teaches you basic stuff about combat and movement, and then you are basically thrown out of the nest. Sure, there is the ingame codex that tells you all kinds things but the wiki/wiki threads will always be your best friend while playing Warframe. Many aspects have to be learned and discovered by yourself which can lead to a lot of new players quitting the game early since they can’t figure out what to do or where to go. You often have to keep the wiki open in the background since there is just that much information to the game.\\n \\nDigital Extremes are in my opinion one of the best developers out there. They communicate with their community and listen to feedback. But even despite that, Warframe suffers from feature creep and old additions to the game that just feel left behind. Great concepts like archwings, raids, PVP or the glorious void fall flat compared to the rest of the game since they get boring pretty fast or just feel unpolished and there haven’t been many updates to them in ages. Additionally, most weapons and mods are just weak compared to other, better versions rendering them either useless or only good if you get a good riven mod for them.\\n \\nRiven mods help to counter the weapon feature creep if you would be able to get them more frequently but unfortunately you only get them from daily missions, warframes daily quests, or other players. These are weapon enhancement mods for a random weapon with random stats, dropped randomly as a reward from said missions. The chance to get one of these is already very small but then you have to get the right mod for the right weapon with the right stats. While stats can be rerolled, most rivens will end up sitting in your inventory forever unless you turn them into endo, sell them, or find a player who is willing to spend some platinum on it.\\n \\nEach faction has its own tilesets which are randomly put together at the beginning of each mission making it less repetitive than it would be otherwise. Each area of the solar system is controlled by a different faction and some of them even by two while the whole galaxy seems to be at war which each other. Enemies look original and well fleshed out and there is a big variety of them present in each faction while all of them have uniquely themed bosses.\\n \\nWarframe offers an overwhelming variety of enemies, locations, weapons and warframes each with their own unique style and charm. It’s easy to get lost in all this and apart from some story quests, it’s really up to the player how he wants to spend his time in this game since Warframe won’t give you any goals, you simply have to set your own, there is no real endgame. Want to be the best looking warframe? Collect all the weapons/warframes/mods? Reach the currently highest Master Rating? Create one of the biggest Clans ever? The possibilities are vast and that is what’s so captivating about this game.\\n \\nObviously, warframe is pretty grind-heavy and can feel pretty tiring at some points. Why is warframe so enjoyable though? First and foremost because of the excellent polish and design in general but also because of its fantastic movement system which features wall-running, double jumping, sliding and more that really help in making you feel like a ninja in space. The shooting is just so refined and precise while different damage and enemy types force you to switch weapons and warframes accordingly based on your next mission. Many different mission types like extermination, spy, defense, and many more ensure that no warframe is truly useless. If you should get bored with your current setup, try recommended builds for warframes and weapons or simply create your own. Augments can help a great deal with this since they can basically enhance your abilities or change how they work, resulting in a different playstyle.\\n \\nCrafting is done similarly to other games where you just get everything and craft it, only in this case you have to wait several hours and for some things even one to three days, but it is fine if you keep building other stuff in the meantime so you get a chain going. Trade missing blueprints from other players or sell your duplicates to them and earn platinum, the premium currency, and use it to upgrade your maximum number of slots, buy weapons/warframes directly of the market or just get some beautiful fashion for your warframe, the business model is just great. But be aware, the number of trades per day is tied to your mastery rating.\\nYes, Warframe is free to play but does that mean that this is hurting it? Not at all, since it is using a very fair business model. Almost all of the things you can buy with the premium currency, platinum, can be farmed without spending any money. Earning this premium currency is rather easy since you are able to trade almost anything with other players and platinum is no exception. Of course, buying things directly from the market is much faster but getting them without spending anything is not only cheaper but also a rewarding experience.\\n \\nWhile Warframe certainly can’t be called high end in terms of graphics, it’s making excellent use of it’s engine and is very slick and clean looking as a result of that. However, the game wouldn’t even look half as good as it can be if one would turn down everything to the lowest settings. Shaders and reflections as well as many other little things add up to create an experience that is not only pleasing to the eye but one that can also stand up to today’s AAA games.\\n \\nBecause of its nature, story is mostly told through quests which there are 20 of. While a handful of them are interesting and make you want to learn more about this universe, most of them are just a series of regular missions with special voice lines and objectives tagged on to it. Sure, there are bits and pieces everywhere in Warframe’s world, but people who are craving for more lore have to utilize wikis and forums to get the whole picture.\\n \\nWarframe’s soundtrack can be astonishingly good at times but being as grindy as it is, most of the songs will sadly fall short in the long term or will get boring to listen to if you hear the same ones over and over again. Otherwise the soundtrack just fits perfectly and some songs even make use of voice which fits for every situation and almost all of the different tilesets have their own songs which fit each of the different factions greatly.\\n \\n \\n \\nBesides it’s fair free to play business model, it offers a huge variety of weapons and warframes and just everything else really but it als offers an insane amount of freedom that is rarely seen in games today. I recommend this gem to anyone who enjoys third person shooters with focus on cooperation or people who are just looking for a grindy experience to pass some time and have fun while doing it.',\n",

The only thing you do not loose is your character (unless you left it on a server that had a random shut down and never got back online - and yes, that happens to official servers too, like server 89.)\\n*Optimization:\\n   - The game lags horribly and freezes in areas where people build big, fully enclosed bases and have a lot of dinos. It can freeze even for 1-2 minutes and could possibly crash too. Then you, say, fall off your bird, your character gets eaten by a wild dino and your bird gets killed by it too.\\n*The game is only for people who have a lot of free time:\\n   - Breeding (without an event that boosts the raising rates) is horribly time consuming... 28hrs for a baby giga? Where you have to hand-feed it every few minutes or it dies? Really?\\n   - Transferring of items between the servers - you can only transfer what you put into your inventory in last 30mins, and once that timer is up, you need to wait another 30 minutes, standing by an obelisk (or tek transmitter if you have one), praying that no wild dino will attack you, that you won\\'t die of cold etc. Very horrible for trading because transferring stacks of metal now takes hours, just for the sake of one dino or blueprint.\\n*Lack of logical solutions and balance:\\n   - End-game is actually not all that fun. They keep \"re-balancing\" the bosses and the ascension, half the time making it impossible to beat it. In the beginning of summer 2017, they made such changes that killing dragon, ape or brood on hard level was almost impossible - and with the dragon, it actually was impossible. No matter how many generations of rexes you must breed and trade for, and imprint, and no matter how good gear you get, it never is enough. The game lacks balanced end-game features that would be achievable through challenges that are possible to complete but do not require glitches or exploits to do that. \\n   - I\\'ve seen changes that made many people quit or be outraged... take the flyer\\'s nerf, where they crippled the whole group of dinos, believing that they were too overpowered, just because they could transport you quickly from one part of the map to the other... I\\'ve seen developers abusing the exploits themselves that they would normally condemn people for: they would put their baby dinos in water in order to keep them in stasis so they didn\\'t need to be fed... Before the game left the early development, its price already jumped from like 20$ to 60-70$? While it still had bugs and badly required fixes and completion (the final boss was not implemented yet).\\n    - Servers being full, player-wise (70/70 players at a time) and dino-wise (5k dinos per server), making it impossible to breed and tame.\\n   - Most changes are for new players, not veteran players.\\nAnd leaving the worst thing yet for the end... Deceit. Developers deceived people. How? Well, let\\'s take a look. Firstly, they promised us all that they would not wipe the official servers upon the game release (which happened somewhere at the beginning of September 2017 I believe), then they said that they would actually do the wipe. And then, when they got a very big outrage from the players, they said that they would split the servers into two: part would be \"Legacy\" and that\\'s where the players who played Ark for 2 years before it left early access would be, and \"the New\" servers, that had no connection to Legacy and were a fresh start for anyone who wanted to do so especially in PvP. \\nThey said they wouldn\\'t wipe the servers... but then they made a list of \"only the barren, ghost-towns\" servers to shut down and repurpose them for the new cluster.... but from just a \"chunk\", it was almost half of all servers. Players had only FIVE days to move from their server (if it was on the kill-off list\") to a different one. 500 dinos, tons of heavy materials, lots of blueprints, fertilised eggs, their water dinos... For most, it was impossible to do a complete move, so some quit completely, and the rest had to give up at least a part of what they had since they coulnd\\'t transfer it all in such a short period of time.\\nAnd then, when everyone settled and thought that the stress is gone... The developers announced that every 3 months, they will be wiping 10% of Legacy servers (\"the bottom ones\", least populated ones) to repurpose them for the New servers... until all Legacy is gone. That being said, ultimately they WILL wipe the Legacy, going against everything they promised to their players, it\\'s just that they will do it over time. And who would want to invest their time, knowing that in the next series of shut-downs, their server might land on the kill-off list? Not many people. That\\'s why most of them either quit, or moved to the New servers (which, by the way, are getting pretty full too).\\nI do not recommend it. Especially not for the current price. At the beginning, the game might be wonderful. But in long-term, especially towards the end-game where the grind is your new daily routine, it gets frustrating. The decay system is horribly punishing, and unofficial servers have it too, because they don\\'t want their maps to be full of bases yet nobody being online, and none of those things being utilized. The developers are not trustworthy with their words and promises, which in the end could cost somebody a lot of emotional stress and feeling of utter defeat, when your years-worth of work goes to hell. Furthermore, it is not good for people who don\\'t have much time. Playing only on the weekends won\\'t just be enough for official servers. It could be for single-player or unofficial servers, but that\\'s about it.\\nI ultimately quit because I had to spent 4 days in hospital, just after the game left early access, and came back to some of my dinos dead from starvation and structures auto-decayed. Then my university started and I understood that my priorities should shift from spending all evenings and some nights on this game, especially knowing that if for some reason I don\\'t manage to log in for a few days, I would loose it all, to focusing on my health and education. There are other, way better survival games out there that are not so high-maintenance but also fun to play - and many of them I would recommend over Ark any day. Just do yourself a favor and do not buy this game.',\n",

Have patience, they\\'re still adding a lot of awesome content and they\\'ll get to the optimization part in time.\\nIt\\'s true, you will experience a lot of stupid stuff like your dinos randomly disappearing, platforms randomly appearing at 50 50, not being able to find your body after you die due to it falling under the map or something like that. Yea, stuff like that can happen, not very often, but it can happen. So what? Get mad and get over it. They are still working on the game and eventually stuff like this will be fixed.    \\nAnyway, in the end, if you like survival games and grinding, you should give ARK a try.

Those aspects of the game are now being resold to us as PAID DLC.  Meaning they are double dipping charging us again for the same promised content.  Technically speaking yes it could still be released at a later date into the core game, however the point is they released this FIRST before finishing the main game.  Also this next point is two sided.  Its great they DO LISTEN to modders and even take those mods and incorporate them into the game.  However the problem is when they take those idea then put them into a paid DLC that has similar features of free mods out there.  This ties into the below qoute from a Wild Card Employee, many of those free \"dlc\" started as community ideas or mods.  Example:  The Center Map\\n3.  The general attitude of employees of Wild Card.  Examples(unverified): \\n\"We don\\'t want to charge players more than we have to,\" he said. \"That\\'s why we give away a lot of free DLC.

Lack of support for said bugs.\\n4.  In my opinion slimey tactics and loopholes to try and brush of the fact they are charging $20 for DLC behind a paywall which is essentialy pay to win:\\n5.  Moderators of the ARK community trying to silence protesters of this madness by creating one single mega thread with a nuetral title to appear there is no outrage or issue with doing this.  \\n6.

No one disputes the core game is solid and worth the money.

       " 'Souce IGN reviews and my own thoughs\\nIn the distant future of Warframe, you are a space ninja who has woken from a long slumber to find the solar system in disarray. Armed with a variety of exciting powers, you must fight an army of decaying clones, tech-minded science jerks, mutant freaks and other awesome enemies. The entire game is free to play, but it’s so good that I spent a hundred bucks on it and don’t regret a cent.\\nFor me, it’s a point of pride that I don’t spend money on free to play games. Spending money means giving in to systems designed to manipulate me; it feels like losing. That constant reminder on players to buy, buy, buy is like a movie theatre interrupting a movie every few seconds to remind people that they can buy popcorn and soda any time they’d like. Not giving in to the ads feels like winning against an intrusive and unpleasant experience.\\nDigital Extremes’ Warframe is different–different enough that I actually bought Prime Access and some platinum. In all, I’ve spent about $100 on the game, something I’ve never done for a free to play game before. I felt like Warframe was worth it.\\nYou don’t have to pay, though, and the game does not constantly dangle the option to pay in your face. The only reminders that you should spend money are located deep within customization menus or in the store, which is a console in your ship that you can easily ignore.\\nWarframe doesn’t care about balance. You’re a badass space ninja, after all! ... What’s great about being overpowered is that, since everyone is overpowered, no one is.\\nThe multiplatform free-to-play game is an action shooter with some of the trappings of an MMO. It launched in 2013 and is available now on PC, PS4 and Xbox One, where it is regularly updated. As a recently-awoken space ninja called a Tenno, your job is to fly around the solar system doing space ninja stuff like assassinations, spying on people, stealing information, and performing sabotage. Each mission location and type remains the same, but the missions themselves are somewhat randomized. The game relies on a random tile system to keep things fresh. Your base of operations–and your main menu–is your ship.\\nWhen you log in, you’re sitting in front of your command console, which lets you select where you want to go in the solar system. To your right is the store. To your left is the codex. Behind you, deeper in the ship, are other stations, like the foundry that lets you build weapons or the armory that allows you to outfit and modify your frames.\\nAh, right, frames. The eponymous warframes operate like character classes, except instead of being locked into one class per character, you can swap frames at will, with each frame having four unique powers. For one mission, you might feel like running the supportive frame Trinity, who can mass heal the entire team or provide energy vampire abilities to ensure quick regeneration. On the next mission, you might want to play as Ember, whose incredible World on Fire ability burns every enemy within a massive radius.\\nYou obtain warframes by defeating bosses and getting their parts or by completing some of the game’s great quests. Warframes are not just some cool gimmick or branding idea, but a cool design choice. Two good ideas make them great: first, they’re all overpowered, and second, you have to hunt them down.\\nWarframe doesn’t care about balance. You’re a badass space ninja, after all! Rather than pushing players through a lengthy and meaningless grind, Warframe provides players tons of awesome and incredibly destructive powers. I love running Frost, a frame that launches a massive blast of ice, freezing everything around it, killing most low-level enemies. Playing like Frost feels like running around as a tactical nuke. The sheer destructive power being wielded is awe-inspiring, but that’s true of every frame. Valkyr’s power is invulnerability. It comes at the expense of ranged weapons, but that’s fine, because as a space ninja, your swords are just as cool, if not cooler, than your guns.\\nWhat’s great about being overpowered is that, since everyone is overpowered, no one is. The power you wield makes you feel like you’re actually a badass space ninja, because you’re killing lots of enemies quickly and efficiently. Other sci-fi games, like Mass Effect 2, force you into cover through a lack of health and a focus on small groups of enemies. There’s no sense of lethality or badassery going on when your character feels like they’re made of soggy toilet paper while enemies can last through an entire magazine of gunfire. Warframe understands this, so every frame feels fun to play, because every frame has powerful, over-the-top capabilities.\\nA friend of mine recently picked up one of the harder-to-obtain warframes, Ivara. He didn’t like her at first, until he realized that, among other things, he could use her abilities to create ziplines anywhere on the map. Ivara drastically altered his mobility and our fireteam’s damage capabilities, allowing us to breeze through content that had previously been too challenging.\\nI’ve played a lot of games over the years, and it seems like most developers’ idea of balance is that everything should feel equally underpowered. The player generally has to play with caution, staying back, even occasionally bunching up, letting enemies come to them as they cheese their way through fights. Warframe’s “you should feel like a ninja” approach encourages more proactive players who slice, dice, and explode their way through hundreds of enemies. I’ve seen builds that kill every enemy on the field at a given time. I’ve watched players one-hit kill a boss and continue onwards as if nothing happened. Warframe’s lethality doesn’t just make you feel effective. It gets you through content quickly, too.\\nMost online games require massive amounts of player time but lack sufficient content to actually demand that time. They rely on heavy amounts of repetition and luck. Players have to play a lot to get a little. Warframe instead allows you to pass through content quickly and always guarantees something interesting at the end of the journey.\\nAs a ninja, you can “bullet jump” through most of the maps. Bullet jumping is a way to bypass lots of enemies by zipping past most enemies faster than they can respond. This means that you can get through missions quickly. That works well with another of the game’s better-implemented elements: timed content. Every few minutes, a new challenge pops up. Sometimes, the reward is credits. Other times, it’s crafting materials. I follow a Twitter feed that alerts me any time a blueprint is available. Combined with the speed at which I can complete content, I can catch a Twitter alert, pop into the game, grab the loot I want, and get back to whatever I was doing without a problem.\\nI recently got an alert for an item I wanted, logged in, played through the mission, and obtained the item within about 10 minutes. The result is a game that can be played in brief 10 to 15 minute spurts, as opposed to a game like The Division, which has a tiny handful of missions that require daily grinding if you want to be able to get enough credits to buy good gear.\\nWarframe’s speed means that it doesn’t doesn’t demand your commitment, but if you’re looking for something more in your relationship, the game’s got you covered.\\nA traditional loot game sends you into an encounter with the expectation of randomized loot. Take Borderlands, for instance. The game claims to have about 87 bazillion guns, but how many of those are meaningful or interesting guns? Most of the guns I’ve encountered in the Borderlands series are samey, even unremarkable, with the exception of a few gag guns. The same is true of The Division; I can’t tell you how many Vectors I’ve located, but I can tell you that they all play the same, just doing more or less damage depending on their stats.\\nI wish more games were like Warframe.',\n",

       " ' It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had. \\nThe premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you\\'ll need to grind.\\nMultiple new game modes exist, including \"Invasion\", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission.\\nThe latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game\\'s melee combat.\\nThe most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy.\\nIn conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new \"EVE Online\"-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard.\\n<hr>\\nA great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole.\\nWarframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. \\nGameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game\\'s metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. \\nWeapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character.\\nSo far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a \"community effort\" in which everyone can participate.\\nThe only \"issue\" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it\\'s a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games \"premium\" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. \\nThe game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its \"free to play\" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you\\'re willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It\\'s always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds.\\nUltimately, if you\\'re just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.',\n",

You start with 2 character slots, 6 weapon slots and 50 plat, 20 plat can get you a character slot and 12 plat can get you 2 weapon slots. You'll pretty much want to spend this 50 plat on slots, as everything else is a waste. Getting more plat costs money and I highly recommend that if you want to spend some money on plat, log into the game every day and wait for the 75% discount to show up. With the discount, a one time purchase of about 1000 plat should set you up for life if all you buy is slots and you don't care about having all the weapons. If you want to collect ALL the weapons, you'll probably want to spend $50 and go for the 3000 plat option.\\nThe mod grind (collecting thingies to improve your stats and the stats of your weapons) can take a stinking long time to work through, but if you can have fun doing it (after all, it just means playing the game a lot), you'll be rewarded with weapons that feel like they do more than tickle the enemies you fire them at.\\nGood mods and good weapons are required if you want to be more than a leech on the later planets, but everyone's usually blasting through the missions so fast that they hardly notice if you lag behind and die horribly to the handful of enemies they overlooked.\\nI'd say the biggest problem this game has is a lack of reasons for veterans to return to old content.

       " \"Hi There!\\nI've put around 450 hours into ARK: Survival Evolved which, compared to many reviews, isn't a huge amount. In this time, however, I've played on both PVP and PVE servers and had a go at hosting a server of my own.\\nWhen I first bought ARK I quit the game after 2 minutes and didn't return to it for months. My PC isn't a beast, but it plays all the games I own at a decent Frames Per Second with good settings. I was absolutely astounded, however, when I could barely hit 10 FPS on the lowest of settings. It was completely unplayable and a great deal of the community had the same problem. A few months later and the developers have patched and updated the game so much that, with a few 'launch parameters', I can play this game at around 50 FPS with good settings. This game IS demanding, but I would think negatively towards anyone who doesn't recommend this game based on it's performance. It's come along way already - think how much further it can be optimised!\\nBut most people know about the performance issues and if YOU didn't know about them before this, I suggest you read into it on the forums etc. to make sure you'll be happy with the game you purchase. Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, let's talk about the gameplay!\\nThe first server I joined was an Official PVP server. This means that the gather rate, XP gain, taming speed etc. was all at standard speed (x1). If you're new to the game, or you've only played on x1 servers this may not seem that bad, but trust me, it gets VERY tedious, VERY quickly. You could end up having to babysit an unconscious T-Rex for hours upon hours while it tames, only for it to get killed in a raid or PVP fight in minutes. If you have the time and patience, then please be my guest.\\nNow, if all the servers had these settings and the modding community wasn't as great as it is, I would have probably never played this game again. Instead, you can find a plethora of servers packed with mods and custom settings that, in my opinion, REALLY bring the game to life! Some servers are a little bit silly, being about to tame an extremely high level Bronto in 2 mins for example, but if that's your cup of tea, don't let anyone stop you!\\nThe aforementioned mods are numerous and varied, ranging from new content such as advanced machinery, to level changing scripts that make wild dinos stronger and even total coversion mods that change the whole game so you're either a pirate or stuck permanently in 'cave-man mode'.\\nI for one, will never be able to go back to a vanilla (un-modded) server with x1 settings. It's too much of a chore. If you're hesitant about wether you'll be able to put up with it too, check the Steam Workshop and you'll see what I mean. Check YouTube too. There are many famous youtubers with daily episodes.\\nI purposely have avoided detailed descriptions of things you can do in this game because I think it's more fun to explore them yourself. Besides, there are many reviews with that kind of info already.\\nI hope this review helped at least some what! \\n-XCAL\",\n",

For example, Dinosaur A has been in the game since release and is effective at farming fiber for you, but shiny new dinosaur B was released a week ago and farms fiber 4x faster, but also farms wood and stone too. Making old content obselete under the guise of \"new content\" isn\\'t really the greatest way to go around \"adding\" new content to the game, since they seem to obselete and effectively remove as much content as they add.\\nI remember the promises of optimisation and direct X12 since VERY early in the development stage.

If you are still an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing reject, then by all means play on the official servers, but be warned, you WILL have to bow before Sargeras and suck some commie♥♥♥♥♥♥\\nIf you are NOT the aforementioned idiot, you will obviously be more drawn towards the private servers. The private servers have increased gather and experience rates and dinosaurs will tame quicker. Sounds great, but wise men teach us that if it sounds to good to be true, it usually is. Although your grind wont be as mind numbingly painful to the point you will be mining stone with your forehead irl, you are going to have to deal with the denizens of a private server. These people are literally the swathes of humanity that have never developed real social skills and will in turn try and grief you at every single chance they get since the world seemingly owes them a favour. You can spend literally hours looking for a good private server, and all you are really looking for is which server has the least amount of Downs Syndrome. \\nTLDR: Nope. Just read the ♥♥♥♥ing review,♥♥♥♥♥♥',\n",
       " 'I will try to make a review that potential buyers of this game will understand. \\nTLDR: Dont buy the game unless you\\'re prepared to dedicate your life to it completely and accept it for all of its flaws.\\n1) THERE IS NO ROOM FOR CASUAL PLAYERS.\\nIf you think you\\'re gonna go into Ark for about 2 or 3 hours, have a good time, live your life normally and pick up where you left off tomorrow, then boy i hope you like receiving a daily dose of anal pounding. Most of the fun stuff they advertise - taming dinos, exploring the map, hunting, breeding, - come second only to defending what you own. Because ARK has no safe zones, everything you acquire in the game has to be stored in areas you yourself have established. Other players who are more active than you WILL destroy your base.\\n2) PVE IS NOT A REALISTIC OPTION. \\nThere are PVE only servers in the game, but literally ALL of them have already been claimed by someone and they have gone out of their way to block all the good spots on the map. Even the spawn points where noobs come in for the first time are all blocked with structures. And since the server is PVE, the game wont allow you to destroy any of the offending structures other players have built, even if it\\'s a straw hut right on top of a spawn point. You might be thinking, \"So go PVP servers and play better then, you noob!\" Well...\\n2) PVP WANTS YOU TO SELL YOUR SOUL TO THE GAME. \\nWinning PVP is not skill based. Whoever dedicates more hours will have more ammo and more dinos and will win every single time. The game requires your tribe to be online 24/7 if you don\\'t want to lose ALL of your progress. That is not an exaggeration. Apart from your character\\'s level, you will lose EVERYTHING if you so much as take a break to study for exams, or talk to your children, or get hospitalized for playing videogames too much because...\\n3) YOU MUST COMPETE WITH THE ENTIRE PLANET. \\nBefore the recent updates, you only had to out-produce the 50 or so people on your server. But now the devs have made it possible for other players from any official server to transfer their high level characters, dinos and items to any other official server. (Note that un-official servers are immune to this but they are unreliable. They will get deleted if the owner stops paying for the rent) This means that megatribes with hundreds of active members can very easily transfer in and reduce your smaller, more casual tribe into a long, greasy underwear stain. \\nIf you and your buddies are casual gamers you either have to be slaves to a megatribe, become a megatribe yourselves or be naked, homeless dudes running around punching trees. There is absolutely no middle ground. Okay... so let\\'s be naked dudes!\\n4) BECOMING A HOMELESS RAIDER IS THE ONLY CASUAL GAME EXPERIENCE TO BE HAD. AND IT SUCKS.\\nBe a nomad, own nothing, build nothing, just come in and destroy people\\'s belongings for the lols. Nothing to lose, so you can log out and play whenever you want. That\\'s one way to play, I suppose. But the problem with that is that you can only really raid, or more appropriately \"grief\" low level players. And if that\\'s how you get your rocks off, then I hope you choke on a♥♥♥♥♥♥ But bigger tribes are basically immune to anything small time raiders with no base can dish out. You\\'ll never get to do anything else, like exploring caves or taming large dinosaurs. And once you are a known griefer in your server, big tribes will probably blow up all your structures on sight. All you can do is grief noobs into quitting the game. \\nThere was a time where ARK allowed for making friends with people on your server and establishing alliances. But these days, the devs are making a lot of changes that discourages you from that. And that is why...\\n5) HIGH LEVEL PLAYERS HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BE COMPLETE D-BAGS TO NOOBS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. \\nBecause anyone from anywhere in the world can now just come in to your backyard with unlimited resources and completely wipe your entire server, security has become a critical issue for powerful but otherwise peaceful tribes. Some random guy can simply create a new character in the server he wants to invade, set up an outpost and unload their powerful gear. \\nAlliances with other tribes could potentially make matters worse. Allied players can come over to your base and your automated defenses will not harm them. This doesnt stop them from planting C4 though... So any invader can come in, pretend to be nice, join one of your allied tribes and you wouldnt be the wiser. He can then just come over to your base and plant bombs on your gate while he says hi to the T-rex that\\'s supposed to be guarding it. And since you have no control over who other tribes recruit, nor can you ask them to pay for any damage they cause, you\\'re better off not allying with noob tribes at all.\\nUnfortunately the only way for established players to truly secure their server from invaders is to not trust anyone. Any noob that tries to come in has to be killed, no questions asked. Even worse, some tribes have now resorted to lining spawn points with defenses to kill anyone trying to enter the server. And as for your already established bases, you will need defenses built en masse if you dont want them destroyed. Which leads to my next point...\\n6) THE END GAME IS 90% GRINDING FOR RESOURCES. \\nBecause of the relentless, global-scale PVP, you need defenses on every side and corner of your base. And that requires literally all of your time grinding non-stop for resources to build and replenish the mass amounts of turrets and bullets needed to repel the inevitable arrival of hostile megatribes, who they themselves are producing at a far greater rate from the safety of their own servers. You may repel them at first. But they will come in waves. Endlessly. At anytime. So for you to survive, it\\'s producing turrets and bullets forever. No fun exploration or hunting... just mining metal and making godamn bullets. If you want to grind resources and build towers, you\\'re better off playing Clash of Clans. But even if you somehow accomplish this, it still doesn\\'t make you safe because...\\n7) THE GAME ITSELF IS FULL OF GLITCHES AND EXPLOITS.\\nIt\\'s bad enough that other players want you dead, but the game itself is actually a much bigger annoyance. Wild dinosaurs can spawn inside your most secure buildings for no apparent reason and destroy your most valuable items/furnitures/dinos before your turrets can have a chance to react. Even your own dinos can literally vanish because the game simply deleted them from the server. You can be in the middle of a heated battle on your most hard-earned dinosaur only for the game to crash, and 5 mins later you come back and you and your dino are already dead. Experienced raiders can even use the game\\'s plethora of exploits to their advantage- turrets not shooting when you carry a dodo with you, or phasing through walls, or creating 2nd accounts to farm resources. You could do everything right and still lose because the game is simply so glitchy. But maybe you\\'re thinking that this is early access, and bugs will be fixed soon? Nope.\\n8) DEVS COULDNT GIVE A SINGLE ♥♥♥♥ ABOUT GAMEPLAY. \\nWildcard is a very small development team that makes money from purchases. Not subscriptions or microtransactions or e-sports. Which means they only make money off of someone who buys their game, not from someone who is still playing it 2 weeks later. Sales quantity over product quality. That\\'s their business model. They add more and more new creatures and items every month to stay relevant and lure in new people, but the same bugs and annoyances that have been around for years are still unchanged.\\nARK is supposedly still in-development, and the idea is that we give them money to finish the game. But instead they have taken all that money to make a paid DLC. This reveals just how low gameplay and player loyalty really are on their priority list.',\n",

I've been through this game and all its rollercoaster crazy nerfs, updates and poor management. I cannot recommend this game or the DLC to anyone anymore in good concience. Do not buy this game!! Do not waste your money!!\\nThe developers keep making promises time and time again and pull through maybe 20% of the time, AT BEST. They rarely listen to the customers, the people giving the feedback they claim to want, about core issues with the game. Things like dinosaurs vanishing, drops in preformance, balance issues after they nerfed so much stuff playing the game isn't even worth it anymore. To name a few.\\nAnd now they release a paid DLC after making promises to make big changes to the actual core game. They didn't pull through on those core changes. The DLC is very lacking, let alone filled with the same holes and multiple issues the core game has and the developers haven't bothered to actually fix.\\nI can't recommend this game. It had a lot going for it when it was first being developed and as the game has progressed, it just continues to get worse and worse. I do not see any hope for this game anymore.

       " \"Before you read into this review, let me ask you one question. Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe. \\nWarframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture. \\nWarframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free. \\nWarframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please.\\nThe Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol,  a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in. \\nAnd then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee.\\nWe've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine. \\nMelee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3. \\nSo yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative. \\nThat said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.\",\n",

       " \"The best F2P game I've ever come across. A fair bit buggy, but that's to be expected. The amount of content/updates that are constantly added to the game are insane. To give an example: If you were to compare what Warframe is now to what it was back in 2013, you'd be playing a completely different standalone game in a technical sense. There's so much to cover that I cannot fit it all into one review, but let's start with the fundamentals. The only other shooter I've played with mechanical depth that can hold a candle to what Warframe allows would be Resident Evil 6. This game's combat system is that deep. I'm not talking about things like Mods or attribute values, I'm talking about the sheer number of movement and attack options you have.\\nIn default mode, the shooting mechanics are pretty straight-forward. But the moment you hit the key to switch to a dedicated melee mode, the game reveals its mechanical complexity. With melee now your primary means of attack, you're able to empower attacks, block/parry, do combos through the use of Stance mods. The game now resembles something closer to a simplified version of Devil May Cry than an traditional shooter. Delaying your melee attacks at key points in animations will allow you to do a comboed move rather than a generic slash. And with most Stance mods having at least 5 combo chains, (in addition to some weapons having multiple dedicated Stance mods) the skill ceiling is significantly increased.\\nBeyond that are your movement options. You can do a sliding slash both on the ground and mid-air. You can run on and scale/hang from walls, dodge in any direction, and can even divekick enemies to knock them down or springboard off of friends and foes alike to complement your standard double jump.\\nThe basic aspects of combat are further supported via the use of Mods. Mods are items that fit into weapons and Warframes alike to help improve and tailor the player's chosen combat style. Every item has 10 Mod slots and 1 Stance or Aura slot. Each Mod has a number value that deducts from a point pool on a chosen item. Mods can also be fused with other mods to improve their effects. Weapons are also able to be fitted with different combinations of elemental mods to produce a new effect. It it through this system that allows Warframe to appeal to virtually any type of player's preferred approach to combat.\\nCustomization is a large part of Warframe, whether aesthetic or stat-wise. You're even able to choose your own ship (though such a choice is purely for show), customize the interior of it along with your frames, weapons etc. Better yet, most Warframes and even certain cosmetic items can be aquired simply through grinding.\\nThis, however, brings us to some of the cons that Warframe can rely on a bit too much at times. The game is very grind-heavy and can eventually wear an individual down as you run the same missions over and over to acquire a certain blue-print, To its benefit, there are a variety of mission types and enviornmental tile sets to go along with them. Furthermore, the game is exceptionally optimized; and is able to keep literally dozens of enemies on screen with respective particle and weapons effects without dropping below 45-50 on a mid-range computer (I had an GTX 660 as reference).\\nAnother problem the game has is its inclination towards being buggy. One of the worst I've heard of so far is the inital Archwing mission causing the game to outright lock up when the game is in Directx 11 mode. There are also numerous other bugs that will crop up as a player puts more and more time into the game.\\nCertain cosmetic items (and even Warframes) are sometimes only purchasable with Platinum, which requires that players spend real money or trade/sell in-game items to other players for Platinum (if one does not wish to spend real money).\\nStory-wise, the game explains very little to the player up front and uses Codexs to allow the player to piece the lore together ala. Dark Souls. With multiple factions each having their own agendas in addition to the Tenno themselves, there is a lot of world building content for players to go through.\\nOverall though, it's an amazing and unique F2P game that will likely not be outdone by its competitors anytime soon. If ever.\\n8.2 out of 10.\",\n",
       " \"A great example of what a F2P game should be\\nPros:\\n*Great visuals\\n*Really well optimised\\n*A lot of content\\n*Crafting system\\n*You can get EVERYTHING in game without paying with real money\\n*Constantly updated\\n*A lot of different ways to play the game\\n*Can be really fun\\n*Well balanced\\n*You can get the premium currency via trading in game\\nNeutral:\\n*Requires a lot of your time\\nCons:\\n*REALLY grindy\\n*You have to wait a lot of time for things to craft (for example to craft a warframe you need to craft all of it's parts which takes 12 hours an then 72 hours to actually craft the warframe itself)\",\n",

       " 'TL:DR The devs are purposely promoting griefing on public servers to try and keep the number of public servers down, as less servers means less money spent on matinence. So either find a private community prior to purchase or do not buy. Also do not just tell me to play singleplayer, your response will be deleted.\\nI have played this game since day one alpha release, and I can tell you right now, there had to be a management and design shift right around march of 2016. In its infancy, the game was incredibly fun. It was a fight for survival, where you would try to get shelter up as fast as possible, just so little bugs wouldn\\'t eat you alive. After that you would gather resources, hunt for food, defend yourself, make armor and weapons. You would then set out for a tame, usually something small like a pig or a parasaur, maybe even a raptor if you want to live dangerous. This tame would help you gather more resources, as it could carry even more resources. This was a rinse and repeat cycle of taming new creatures to serve different purposes, to then help expand your base and get better and better tames, with an end goal of fighting a boss. \\nYou could go solo, or make/join a tribe, allowing several players to work together, this made the game INCREDIBLY more fun (getting on a bunch of high level raptors with friends and devouring anything you came across was incredibly satisfying). Then you could work with or against other tribes, as you could trade resources or give old tames if they are newer. You could also go to war with another tribe, attacking their base, proving your worth. The other option is to take your tame and go stomp the dude who just made his first thatch hut, this is where the problems start. At first there was only minor griefing and was mainly done by Brazilians (I don\\'t know why, and I have nothing against brazilian people, its just the griefers on the servers I played on way back were all brazilian). They would run up to you naked with a spear, and try and stab you to death. Usually you were with a tame or had a weapon and could easily deal with them, and to be honest, isnt really game breaking as hes just a naked dude with a spear. As more and more people became aware of what these guys were doing, it became less of a problem as anyone who found a Br (brazilian) would call it out, and we would stay on guard for a bit and they would eventually get tired of getting slaughtered and leave. \\nFast foward a few months, and now they updated the pteranadon, a fast flyer for those who dont know, giving it a barrel attack move. This would increase the damage it did significantly, and make it move incredibly fast. This was cool at first, but was quickly adopted by more advanced griefers, as pteranadons were very easy tames. The game quickly became litered with people getting pteras, flying around and dashing through people, killing them, or worse, swooping in extremely fast, picking them up, flying high, and dropping them, causing no kill message to occur. This was an insane problem for newer players as they had no way of fighting back, causing them to get whiped repeatedly for just attempting to play the game, and was even an issue for advanced players as if you had things like rifles on your body and he insta killed you before you could kill him, the guns were now his and he could grief even more people with them. As far as I am aware, the ptera issue is still highly presistant to-date. \\nThe next issue was server dominance. Some servers would get to the point where only one tribe was on them as they whiped out every other tribe on the server. Many of the now \"legacy\" servers still have this issue, and its bound to happen with the new ones. If you go on one of these dominated servers, not knowing it, you would wake up and your character would be handcuffed,  in a prison with full weight so you couldn\\'t jump to drain stamana to die, so unless you wanted to wait 2 hours for your food to run out and starve everytime you wanted to start over on that server, you just ditched that server and looked elsewhere. I actually met the individual who made spawn camping a bannable offense, as he spent 2 real life days with a friend, building metal traps at each and every spawn location on the map, trapping any character who freshly spawned on the server, This was in an attempt to lock down their server to the point that they wouldn\\'t have to worry about sweeping their server every day to make sure no new spawns showed up. Now this was a really messed up thing, but at least it was contained to that server, keyword being was.\\nNow with the two issues I just told you about, and the devs doing NOTHING to stop it (except for the spawn camping, but i\\'ll get to why they banned that later), they did the last thing anyone but griefers and mega-tribes wanted. They added server transfering. Now in theroy this is to allow active players to swap from an inactive server to a active one, without losing all of their stuff. This is actually really neat, and if it was only used for this purpose then I\\'m all for it. What happened though was there was a very short cooldown on transfering, and you could bring EVERYTHING from one server to the next, all tames, all gear, any/all supplies. In the following days, those mega-tribes I mentioned before, that were farming resources, extremely powerful tames, and extremely high quality gear, would start to server hop at night, when no one was on, starting in one corner of the map and working their way to the other, wiping out any and all tribes on said server, leaving everyone there, who has played for months or even over a year, and get wiped by guys they never saw before. As far as the ptera griefers went, they just transfered server to server, killing people, taking their stuff, than then leaving the server, with no way of knowing where they went, so there is no way to even attempt getting back at them.  \\nOnce all this happened, I stopped playing for a while, as so did many, but months later I heard they did away with server transfer, so I started playing again. They then released scorched earth, and a few buddies of mine and I got it and played together, and it was incredibly fun. Then came the patch notes, and guess what, server transfering was back, after a lot of people payed money for the expansion. \\nPlayers attempted to make server transfer non existent on the player side, by blocking the obilesk, the giant pointy towers, as thats how you would transfer stuff. The devs later made it to where at any loot drop, you could transfer stuff, this led players to blocking loot drops, meaning now all that rare loot, you could no longer aquire. The devs then made drops land on top of objects, meaning you could no longer block them, and made blocking oblisk bannable. This lead to server transfer becoming an issue again, and people started getting unfairly wiped again by people who used unethical methods of warfare and would raid offline tribes.\\nIt then became clear their goals were to scam people into buying the game, and then ruin it after they get it so they can shut down servers. At this point, bugs were not being fixed, and more and more unbalanced content, that only made mega tribes stronger, was being released. This was clearly to reel in new players, with all the cool videos of the game, only to find out its griefer city. Now, remember when I said I\\'d explain why spawn camping was specifically the only griefing made banable? It was because if a new player jumped on a dominated server, unknowingly, and was spawn camped, they would maybe try 2-3 more times, but would probably give up, uninstall the game and get a refund. By banning spawn camping, new and unsuspecting players would easily be able to play past the 2 hour refund window before learning all their hard work was for nothing as their character ends up in a prison and everything they made, just gone.',\n",

       " \"I purchased ARK almost as soon as it came up on Early Access back in June of 2015. I've seen ARK evolve from its earliest days to where it stands now. I also own the dubious Scorched Earth expansion. I've taken part in pretty much every kind of activity to be found in ARK: solo building, working with small public tribes, all the way up to large scale alpha tribe vs alpha tribe PVP. Granted, there are -plenty- of people who have more time in ARK than me, but I've pretty much seen it all. Now with all that said, and considering everything I've seen and played, I cannot recommend ARK. Here's why.\\nIf you really, really wanted to boil it down into the most basic explaination possible, it's because ARKs combat is simply not fun. All the other issues in the game all relate back to this point in one way or the other. Allow me to explain. \\nLook at ARKs promotional videos and ask yourself what you see. You'll see armies of players alongside T-Rexes fighting across open fields. You'll see epic assaults on heavily defended bases by seige platforms mounted on mighty dinosaurs. Look at the promotional pictures here on Steam. You'll see trader caravans escorted by raptor cavalry making long treks across the island. You are probably thinking of buying the game so you too can take part in these epic struggles for survival.  \\nI'll tell you right now that you will NEVER experience ANY of that. Wanna know how ARK combat REALLY goes down? You farm up C4 for a week and then wait for your target to go offline. Then you and your tribe go to their base, which is in fact not an epic castle but a metal cube slathered in auto-turrets, and you drop friggin turtles on their base until their turrets run out of ammo. Then you take your C4 and blow your way in. If their dinosaurs are all on passive stance, just shoot them in the face until they die. If they are on nuetral, lure them out of the base and have your own dinos kill them at your leisure. Once all their dinos are dead, just keep blowing stuff up and stealing everything until you run out of explosives. If your REALLY lucky, one of their guys might get on and you MIGHT have a firefight. Then the next morning you can get on and hear them crying that they lost 6 months of work in one night. Eventually, one day you will suffer the same fate. Of course, all of this is assuming that you and your tribe reach the point where you can raid bases, and that you and your tribe weren't effortlessly curbstomped by an already established tribe the moment you set down your first foundation. \\nThe entire game, and I do mean the ENTIRE GAME, consists of nothing but months of grinding resources to do that exact thing. ARK demands that you invest so much time in it that it might as well be a part time job, and when the chips are down and all is said and done, the end result of all your labor is going to be blowing up a metal cube. Every other activity in the game is nothing but grinding up to get to that point. \\nIn summery, all the neat gear, all the cool dinosaurs, and all the other features of ARK become a zero sum game when the end experience is something as uninspiring as offline raiding.\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\nAddendum: It has come to my attention that many people are expressing their opinion that options such as PvE mode, private servers, mods, etc invalidate my points and redeem the game. \\nFirstly, if the community of players have to start enforcing their own personal rules (ie. private servers) or adding their own content (ie. mods) in order to make the game palpable, then that is a telling sign that the games core, fundemental mechanics are intrinsically flawed. I do not believe it is the responsibility of the community to fix a games flaws. Things like mods and private servers should be tools to enchance an already well built game, not used as crutches to sidestep a games core issues. I am writing my review concerning the game as the developers intended it to be played; which I believe has serious shortcomings that show no signs of getting fixed. I don't think its fair to potential customers to review a game any other way.\\nSecondly, PVE servers suffer from a myriad of problems. First and foremost, by eliminating direct player competition, you remove about 50% of the games entire premise. I found that some of the most fun aspects of ARK involved server politics such as alliances, betrayals, territorial skirmishes, rescues, ambushes, etc etc. By taking out any form of player vs player engagments, you can forget about all that. Which leaves you with... what exactly? You will collect dinosaurs to sit in your corral, you go spulunking through a few caves, and MAYBE if your REALLY lucky, you'll fight a boss with some other players, although good luck getting enough people to help you with that last one. The fact of the matter is that the PVE elements to this game, while much deeper than other survival games out there, are simply not compelling enough to stand on their own two feet. That's not even touching on the fact that PVE servers STILL have ways where other players can screw you over (for example, surrounding your base with foundations to prevent you from building, and preventing resources from spawning nearby) and since it's a PVE server you have absolutely no methods of retaliating.\\nARK has great potential and can frankly be a lot of fun. People wouldn't spend 500+ hours in this game if it wasn't at least kinda fun. However, the fact of the matter is that it's potential is horribly squandered by boring combat, tedious grinding, balance issues, and several downright stupid mechanics (bringing back server transfers? After what happened last time? Really?). Paying customers should not have to put up with this considering how long ARK has been in development. At this point, it's obvious the game is only going downhill, so I can't recommend it to new players.\",\n",

       " 'Well lets start with what kind of game Warframe actualy is. It\\'s published by DE (digitals extremes), it\\'s action game (someone would even say ninja game even though there are no ninjas in this game), no doubts about this and it\\'s sci-fi game, also no doubts about this thing, and it\\'s also 3rd person shooter right? Well I think we have 1st doubt right here, because you see, even though warframe is 3rd person without any possibility to go to 1st person it\\'s not just a shooter, in fact melee system i (imo) way better than gun system. But i will talk about weapons later.\\nNow let\\'s talk loadout and gear. You play as \\n a.k.a \"space ninja suit with awsung powers\" Right now there are 33 warframes (when we don\\'t count \"prime\" frames -> better versions of normal frames with same powers but just slightly better stats like armor, health etc.) Every one completely diferent than others with unique looks and abilities. About year ago there were 281 weapons in total, so now it\\'s easily over 300. You can choose from primary weapons, secondary weapons and melee weapons, there are also better variants of regular weapons (\"prime\", \"wraith\", \"vandal\" and very special \"dex\" right now there are only 3 dex weapons because they were added as anniversary) but i will talk about them later together with factions and some lore (if i won\\'t forget that is). And with weapons it\\'s the same... they are all unique from other weapons (well... at least with appearance because you cant make that much of a difference in stats) that said, there are still varieties of weapons. (i will put link for wiki if you will be actually interested)\\nFor \\n there are rifles, snipers, shotguns, bows, launchers, \"specials\" (stuff like flamethrowers and LMG weapons and they are taken as rifles ingame) and spearguns (you can shoot or you can throw) \\n are pretty similar (but ingame they are not as divided, they\\'re just secondary weapons) but you can find single held / dual held pistols (they dont look and usualy dont function like normal pistols, but it\\'s closest to real life pistols than anything else) shotgun secondaries (also one handed / two handed), shotgun-pellet secondarY (shotgun that can fire normal shotgun pellets or shoot slug with alternative fire), yet there is only one weapon like that, throwing secondaries (throwing stars and knifes), beam secondaries (they deal dmg/s in beam, they dont have bullets... duh)\\nAnd finaly \\n... so there are:\\nBlade and whips, daggers, dual daggers, swords, dual swords, claws, fist weapons, gunblades, heavy blades, hammers, hybrid weapons (two handed sword that can be changed into dual swords), machetes (most of them suck... :D at least that\\'s what most of people think, but with new stance they are finaly good :D), nikanas (basicly katanas), nunchakus, polearms, rapiers, scythes, sparring weapons, staves, sword and shields, glaives, tonfas and whips. Over 100 melee weapons in total. Also i mentioned \"stance\" earlier, stance is mod that you can put on melee (every melee type has its own stances) that allow you to make melee combos (that is what i meant when i said melee system is better than gun system).\\nAnd here is the weapons list if you want any details: \\nAlso you can have \\n (not talking about weapons anymore, but still talking about loadout) you can either have small robot-ish things -> \"sentinels\" that fly behind you (they have diferent mods that allow them to have specific role, by that i mean there is \"shade\" that can make you invisibru or there is \"helios\" that scans things for you - that is for codex, ingame stuff that realy doesn\\'t affect gameplay) and they use their own weapons, but you cant see them, or you can have live companions, cat a.k.a \"kavat\" or dog a.k.a \"kubrow\" there are several types of kavats and kubrows (including infested kubrow) that also have mods for specific attacks. Also you can modify their looks, you can add armor to both sentinels and animals, but it doesnt affect stats, it\\'s purely just for sake of fashion. Also you can\\'t have two comapions active at once.\\nI should not forget about \\n -> special mode where you get pairs of space wings and new space weapons (only primary and melee) and you fight in space. It\\'s fun feature in to the game, but it is annoying after a while, but dont worry you will have fun with it first couple of dozen hours of playing.\\nNow when damage dealing things are behind us let\\'s talk a bit about \\n it self. Loong time ago there was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dmg system and then DE made \"damage 2.0\" and now we have complex damage system. Basicly almost all weapons have physical damage: impact, puncture and slash ÿou can add critical chance and you can add status effects on them, every type of damage is strong and weak against some types of enemies, if you are realy interested look here: ',\n",

       " 'I know, I know. Another negative Warframe review from a salty player with lots of hours in the game. How original.\\nLook, you\\'ve probably heard plenty of crap about this game from other negative reviews, but this is just my two cents:\\nFor the amount of time you put into this game to earn things, you could achieve so much more in other games.\\nFor the amount of money you put into this game, you could gain so much more from other free-to-play titles.\\nBut what is it recently that made me quit?\\nWell, a fair few months ago, when Vauban Prime came out, I took a ~8 month break from the game, because of how unbelievably grindy it got. DE (the developers) increased the resource cost of things astronomically - like how some resources can only be obtained during rare, limited-time missions (nitain extract) or rare resources that remove themselves from your inventory after just 24 hours (Argon Crystals).\\nBut it\\'s okay, because DE releases fresh new content sometimes, right? Well, every time DE implements something, it\\'s terribly implemented. Atrociously so. But sometimes DE comes back and revisits this content, sticks \"2.0\" at the end of the name, and treat it like a whole new thing. They might fix some issues, but introduce a slew of new problems.\\nAn example of this is the \"focus\" system. Basically, without spoilers, you get certain types of XP for certain types of skill trees by using weapons or gear with a certain attatchment on them. When this was introduced, gaining \"focus\" points was ridiculously slow. After a while, DE responded to community complaints by advertising that they\\'d introduce a consumable that would appear on the map after certain time intervals, and give all players a 6x multiplier on their focus gains. Awesome, right?\\nWhat they really did was nerf how much Focus you get by making it an absolutely tiny fraction of what people were initially complaining about - then the 6x multiplier would only make up for the nerf. This is in the same update, mind you. And DE didn\\'t communicate this at all.\\nAnd now they\\'ve moved on again, forgetting about the focus system, just like every other previously implemented system in the game.\\nUpdate 18.13 introduced nerfs to warframes (exoskeletons that are essentially interchangable classes) that didn\\'t deserve a nerf. Many warframes that previously filled niche purposes were suddenly completely useless or outdone by other warframes. Certain builds people had on their warframes were now irrelevant. It was a♥♥♥♥♥♥show. And DE left it like that.\\nBut for the longest time, people had been asking DE to balance all weapons in the game. Because there are hundreds of them - and it\\'s a mess. Some can instantly wipe out all high level enemies in the vicinity, others require constant firing for minutes on end just to take down the same enemy. It is the worst I\\'ve ever seen in any game.\\nBut that\\'s okay, because DE created a fix that came with update 19, otherwise known as The War Within. This fix would be known as...\\nRiven mods. Basically, these are meant to be how DE rebalances the weapons of Warframe. And it is just the worst thing I\\'ve ever seen be added to the game.\\nBasically, Riven mods are mods for your gear that make them better. And they can make them way better. The problem? This didn\\'t just apply to the terrible weapons that needed rebalancing - this applied to all weapons. And this is meant to be the fix that rebalanced weapons. I cannot fathom the stupidity behind this decision. It\\'s laziness and stupidity.\\nWant to rebalance all weapons in the game, just like the players asked for? Sweet! Players will now have to grind against a time-locked grind on sortie (daily) missions for a small chance at obtaining a Riven mod, which then requires player to complete another arbitrary task just to \"unveil\" the Riven mod and make it usable, and then the player is left in the hands of RNG on what weapon the Riven mod worked with.\\nThat\\'s right, Riven mods are locked to only working with ONE weapon. Just one. Out of hundreds. It could be something you don\\'t even own. It could be for a useless weapon, and still not make it good enough to compete with the high-tier weapons, or just be further nerfs to what are already the best weapons in the game.\\nSo what do these Riven mods do? \\n These mods can do anything from giving a flat-out boost to damage, coming with useless buffs (adding additional % slash damage on a weapon that only 1% of it\\'s damage as slash) or even nerfs, such as decreased damage and increased recoil.\\nDidn\\'t like the way your Riven mod came out? You can reroll the traits it has with a whole new resource that requires a constant, conscious effort to grind, all while the cost for re-rolling your Rivens increases with every re-roll.\\nHowever, DE did make two fixes: they capped the resource increase for re-rolling Rivens to 3500 kuva, and made it so lesser-used weapons gain stronger buffs from Riven mods. But only after community outcry. Because the devs are so lazy, oblivious and moronic that it took the players say \"umm, buffing \\n with rare mods doesn\\'t fix the weapon balance issues\" for them to change anything. And when they did \"fix\" it, it barely made a difference.\\nThe Glast Gambit came out a few days before I wrote this review. With it, a new weapon was introduced - the Hema, and a new warframe - Nidus.\\nNow, what\\'s great about some warframes is that you can get their parts in quests. Sure, these quests were super grindy, but it was better than the alternative - many warframes in the game can only be obtained by having boss enemies drop CERTAIN PARTS of CERTAIN WARFRAMES which requires credits, resources and TWELVE HOURS EACH TO BUIILD and THEN you may construct the warframe with the final stage of crafting - actually constructing the warframe. Which takes SEVENTY-TWO HOURS.\\nIn quests, as you complete each grindy objective, you\\'re rewarded with a part, which you craft - for credits, resources, and and a twelve hour wait. But it\\'s better than having the part drop from a boss - where there is only an obscure chance that you get the part you want. This was the case with the warframe known as Chroma.\\nDE decided Chroma was clearly too easy to get, after a while, and decided to split up the pieces and making rewards for clearing different systems, sets of levels, and side objectives. Yep.\\nNow, the Glast Gambit rewards you with one piece of the Nidus warframe - the blueprint. Not other part. The other parts can only be obtained from a LOW DROP RATE from only EVERY FOURTH ROUND from a \\n That\\'s right. You have a low chance every foruth round after much repitition on just one level - the only level to contain this new game mode - and play it over and over and over and over again until you get the warframe parts. Which then require twelve hours, some credits and some resources to complete. And then you may build the warframe - requiring a 72 hour wait.\\nWell, that\\'s♥♥♥♥♥♥ So what about the new weapon, the Hema?\\nIt requires mutagen samples. A lot. Mutagen samples are a very uncommon resource that can only be found in certain areas of the game, and \\n Now, you see, weapon research gets a bit cheaper when your clan has less players.

Also melee play is an actual, and reliable choice.\\nThe controls are laughably easy to get into, after an hour I was completely used to it.\\nAnd, now with the new update 14, there is an new and better intro to the game.

       " 'I\\'ve been playing Warframe since 2013, and still do today. \\nA bad thing about Warframe -> people are lacking creativity. Most of the players seem to play like blind people, since almost every player is focused on ONE thing... Leveling up, and when they\\'ve reached the current max lvl they complain about a lack of content and nothing more to do...\\nWarframe is a game of customization, filled with opportunities to make every player fit in. Every weapon, Warframe, Archwing etc. can be good. People often seem to think that the prime/stalker weapons are the only thing to use, and that the \"how to mod: ____\" videos on YouTube is the only well working option to make a weapon good. But that is in most cases a big mistake from the players. Sure a starting mk.1 weapon is not as good as the prime one, and of cause there is nothing bad about getting modding inspiration from videos. The thing is, if you put enough effort into a Weapon/Warframe/Archwing/Companion, then that might just work just as good. Why try to make the Ignis good, if you don\\'t like the way it\\'s shooting, why not go for an old school Burston if that\\'s what you prefer?\\nA lot of people seem to only focus on those things: ranking up and getting good loadouts. It\\'s like people seem to forget what the game is trying to offer you. Try to do something different if you don\\'t like the game. Join a clan, do some Archwing races, finish the quests, challenge yourself like how long can you defend the objective and even better, how long can your squard which you currently are chatting with, having a good time, laughing together about how stupid and yet addorable Clem is, defend the objective!\\nDon\\'t be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and join a clan because they\\'ve got full research and no taxes. When you join a clan, think of it as you join a community, sure some clans are only out there because of the remaining items they need to reach max lvl.\\nDo yourself a favour and look for a clan with a great working community, it doesent have to be a big clan, it can be even more exiting to help a clan grow from the bottom, reqruit players, and experience how a community can be made from a single free to play game.\\nAnd don\\'t come and say the game is pay to win, because it\\'s not... As they added trading in Warframe, every player is able to get as much platinum as they want. The only thing they can\\'t get without paying is the steam workshop items, and the prime access accessories.... But those are all cosmetics... So let\\'s just forget about the whole P2W thing people are complaining about.',\n",
       " 'As someone who is very asocial and not a team player, I can honestly say this game kinda\\' broke me out of that shell. I\\'m not one for online games that requires social interaction, but this game becomes so addicting that it makes you wanna work with others to get sh*t done. Though you don\\'t necessarily have to play with other people if you don\\'t want to, but it\\'s a lot faster trying to get things accomplished. The game is very grindy, RNG heavy, and requires a shtload of investment if you wanna make any real progress. So if you have a life then avoid this game lol. There\\'s been times where other players have p*ssed me off (which is any online game really) but I\\'ll get to that at the bottom of this review.\\nYou are a Warframe, aka \"Tenno\" (think of a space ninja lol). There are enemy factions at war with each other. Your job is to fight them. You can do spy missions, defense missions (defend cryostasis pod), exterminate missions (kill all enemies), etc. At the end of these missions you get rewards like blueprints to make weapons and new warframes, component parts, credits (in-game currency), mods (which you can equip on your weapons and warframes.... mods like Melee damage +90%, etc). You can customize the colors of your weapons and warframes, customize the interior of your spaceship, you can have a sentinel or pet to assist you in battle, just all kinds of cool stuff here and there. Then there\\'s this other currency called Platinum, which you have to buy with real money, or another way to get Platinum is to farm for prime parts to sell to other players. You need this if you run out of space to use weapons and warframes, or if you want to buy accessories for your appearance, speed up the building process of weapons, warframes, etc.\\nPersonally what I think is a pain in the az, are the wait times you have to endure when building sh*t. OH WHAT\\'S THAT? You FINALLY got all the parts to build the warframe or weapon you\\'ve been wanting? It\\'ll only take 3 f*ckin\\' days to build it :D Don\\'t like waiting that long? Spend some plat to speed it up! Don\\'t have plat? Welp..... guess you\\'ll just be waiting then :D ....... or you can.... you know, buy some plat? :D Oh and don\\'t forget to take your Master Rank test to increase your rank to use better weapons, etc! Oh you failed? Welp...... 24 hour wai..WHAT THE F*CK!!!\\nThen of course before you can even build your stuff you need the parts first, which requires mindless grinding and a chunk of time. And there\\'s no guarantee you\\'ll actually get the specific parts you want because of the RNG system. Like for example, there\\'s Prime versions of Warframes and weapons you can get, and in order to get them you need to get relics (objects that you obtain from doing missions which hold specific prime parts within them). To get the prime parts from the relics you need to do Void Fissure missions, which is basically you fighting these holy looking azholes and getting them to drop this stuff called reactant which will crack open the relic once you have 10 reactant. Sounds easy, but the problem is that there are 6 prime parts in the relic, and the game randomly picks an item out of the relic. Or if you\\'re playing with 3 other people the game will randomly pick 1 prime part from each persons relic, thus making farming a bit easier. So that gives you an idea of how time consuming this process can be when you\\'re trying to farm for something specific. This game is nothing but poke and hope and saying \"Hey guys look at this stuff I have that you don\\'t have\", and definitely isn\\'t for the impatient lol. That\\'s all I\\'ve been doing for almost 700 f*ckin hours, not that I\\'m complaining but yeah this will suck the soul out of you and possibly turn you into a Warframe crackhead.\\nAs for the Warframe Community, this game surprisingly has some really nice people that are willing to help you out if you\\'re not afraid to ask. And in a way I guess it makes sense considering this game literally doesn\\'t teach you sh*t, doesn\\'t handwalk you at all, barely gives you any instructions as to what the f*ck is going on and how to play the game. I had to look up most information on the internet, the Warframe Wiki and a bunch of YouTube videos. I think the developers need to step it up in that department as well as other aspects. As mentioned above, I\\'m very asocial and hate people but this game kinda\\' showed me that not everybody on the planet is a d*khead with the mindset of a 12 year old. One random guy saw me asking for help in the region chat, decided to personally message me, and spent like 400,000 credits to upgrade some mods for me and spent a bit of Platinum to help me out. Completely shocked me I\\'ll be honest. ALTHOUGH, some of the players on here are big babies.... like actual manchildren no joke. \\nThere are warframe players in this game with Elitist mentalities that will throw fits when you don\\'t play the game the way they want you to play, the \"hardcore math on paper tryhards\" and it\\'s quite annoying... especially for someone like me. It\\'s very rare that you encounter these turds, but every now and then it happens. Like this one time I was playing as Valkyr Prime (a very melee heavy warframe) and was doing a Sortie mission called Mobile Defense, where you have to go to a spot and kill the enemies and keep them from destroying data you\\'re protecting. I was playing with 3 other randoms and this guy was btching because I was getting most of the kills, said he can\\'t stand Valkyr and told me I need to pick a better warframe lol. I\\'m sorry but last time I checked I thought it was Valkyr\\'s job to go around and tear sh*t apart? lol I mean honestly it\\'s not my problem if you\\'re slow at killing enemies, but I\\'m the one that needs to pick a better frame? Don\\'t whine and b*tch to me, go cry to the developers and tell them to nerf Valkyr if you don\\'t like it lol. On that note, I think I need to take a break from this game, because f*ck anxiety XD\\nI do enjoy the game though, I\\'d be lying if I said I didn\\'t, so thumbs up.',\n",
       " \"TL;DR at the bottom.\\nMain features at the bottom before TL;DR\\nCons:\\n1. Pretty bad tutorial.\\nThe tutorial simply guides you through basic combat, and nothing more. The more complicated mechanics such as mods and damage types are barely touched on. These two main mechanics are crucial in-game, and due to the lack of a tutorial for it, I've encountered far too many new players who are clueless. You will have to google for a crap ton of information. (Bless the wiki page)\\n2. Pay-4-Convenience.\\nIf you're rich, you get through majority of the game faster. But it is NOT Pay-2-Win. Everything is obtainable, and the grind isn't insane unless RNGesus hates you. A person who paid money and a free-to-play player will end up with the exact same gear. Essentially, you buy time in this game, and nothing more.\\n3. Limited areas to play in.\\nIt's not open-world. Instances have a certain tileset for each planet. It randomizes, but generally remains the same. There are, of course, new tilesets added in certain updates.\\n4. It's easy to get burnt out.\\nBy burnt out, I mean that you'll probably play the game on and off when you first start. This is due to the long waiting times for crafting new items, which are the only way you can get new items on your own. That tied with the daily trade limit makes it difficult to play for several hours straight. But once you've attained a fair amount of items, getting burnt out becomes few and far between.\\n5. You're free to do what you want.\\nThis can't be a bad thing, right?  But it is for those who want some form of direction in a game.  I initially found it really hard to stick to playing this game. I love every aspect of it, but having no actual goal is painful. This game is recommended for those who like loot-based games like Diablo 3.\\nPros:\\n1. Everything is obtainable if you play the game. (With the exception of the Founders Pack)\\nYeah, play the game and get everything. Simple as that. Wanna get something that is no longer available? Trade. \\n2. Fantastic Graphics on low-end PCs\\nI'm able to run this on a PC with only 2GB of RAM and an Intel Graphics card. I've upgraded since then, but it runs at a smooth 30 FPS on that disgusting old rig.\\n3. Gameplay.\\nGameplay doesn't get dull, unless you're one of those cancerous people who plays Ash-hole. Fast paced, and both melee-only and ranged-only builds are viable. \\n4. The Dev team.\\nIt's clear that the Warframe dev team cares about the game and does not try to turn it into a cash-grab. New expansion? Free. New item being released? Don't need to fork up any money. New mission? Do the pre-reqs and gain access to it. Entirely new mechanic that could possibly act as DLC? FREEEEE.\\n5. Community.\\nYou will rarely ever encounter any cancer players. Why? Because Warframe heavily relies on working with others. If you're a horrible person to group with, you'll build up a bad rep and eventually no one will group with you. The downsides of being an♥♥♥♥♥are so huge, that if Kanye played this game, you'd think he's Oprah or Ellen or one of those nice people that everyone likes.\\nFeatures\\n+ A lot of 'Warframes' which act as classes (extremely flexible)\\n+ Detailed mechanics (modding, damage 2.0)\\n+ Large amount of viable weapons (majority are extremely different from each, all are able to be molded to endgame)\\n+ Fantastic graphics (recently got a revamp with better smoke and fire physics)\\n+ Incredibly optimized (expect smooth framerates throughout)\\n+ Plenty of customization and cosmetics (you will rarely find another person that looks exactly like you)\\n- Dull movement system (despite having a parkour system, you'll be rolling/bullet jumping everywhere. This is starting to change with the added Orokin Moon Tileset)\\n- Limited areas to play in\\n- Repetitive (very limited number of mission types)\\n- PvP is pointless (you don't get much other than cosmetics)\\n- Ridiculously grindy\\n- A lot of flukes (there are certain builds that do all the work by pressing A SINGLE BUTTON. I kid you not. Check out 'Warframe draco runs' on youtube.)\\n- Limited trades each day (tallies with your Mastery Rank, which you can increase by leveling items)\\n- Limited inventory (appears as a cash grab quite early on, but you can earn Platinum through trading)\\n- Certain items are obtainable at certain times (2 main items; orokin catalyst and orokin reactor. They are untradable, and I've personally wasted over 400 Platinum on the market buying them because I missed an alert that was only available for 1 HOUR. The recipe that can be bought on the market is stupid)\\nTLDR;\\nIt's free, but can appear as P2W. \\nYou can obtain everything if you spend time and effort.\\nPlay if you like loot-based games.\\nExpect to wait. A lot.\\nCommunity is awesome.\\nDevs are awesome with constant updates and hotfixes.\\nBeing a Helicopter with dual axes is fun (yes you can do that in this game)\",\n",

But to make up for the lack of assisstance, most of the community would be willing to help you out if you just ask. Hell even sometimes give you free stuff to start off.\\nThe General Player: This is where the majority of both new and old players either get loads burnouts or just straight up quit the game. As all they see is \\'grind, grind, grind, and more grind\\'. Yes that is basically the entire game, but that means they\\'re missing the \\'hidden\\' message of the game (not really, just wanted to make it sound cool)\\nTo put it simply in my own words.. Because it\\'s fun. You\\'re probably thinking \"How the hell can endless hours of constant grinding be fun\" or something along those lines. Well that\\'s the exact same mindset for those new and old players who did quit the game, which leads to the final phase.\\nThe True Space Ninja: As repetitive any gamemode may be in Warframe, the amount of frames and weapons to choose from make the grind not just bearable, but legitimately fun. Even the worst kinds of weapons can be surprisngly effective or do the most hilarious things you would not see in any other game. The joy of bringing the wrong set up to a mission, then finding out by the end it worked better than expected.\\nTo avoid making this review anymore lenghty, I would say to truly enjoy Warframe; Change your usual set-up for certain mission types, challenge yourself with small but fun objectives while in mission, helping other players can be either  fustrating to funny experiences or a nice break from the constant grinding',\n",

I will tell you.\\nI played Warframe since the beggining, no Vor\\'s Prize as intro or 4 revives per mission (more like 4 revives per day) the grind was just as bad as it is now, this is a free 2 play game expect some type of grind, but I liked the gameplay so I stuck around for more, they developed more content pretty fast, so I kept coming back, the community grew, I lurked like a lurker and watched as the lore grew and evolved.\\n2 or 3 years of that and then the Second Dream quest came around...\\nI\\'ve kept this in mind It\\'s a F2P game, it does not have to be a rich game, hell even HOTS said \"You shouldn\\'t think too hard about these things\"\\nSo yeah space magical ninjas! go and have fun!\\nBut Second Dream came they have made a storyline.

       " 'Firstly lets talk about the basics, Warframe is a third-person over the shoulder Shooter, in it you control your character and complete missions and quests taking place on the different planets in the solar system, and if that sounds pretty generic thats because it probably is, however you are not some generic soldier, you take control of the Tenno, a race of basically humans designed as living weapons by a long dead ancient race, who are lead by The Lotus (space mum) to keep the peace in the solar system.\\nLets talk about the gameplay, The controls are pretty standard (WASD to move, Space to jump etc.), but theres actually a bit more to it than running around and shooting, some missions require you to be stealthy instead of aggressive, and since the Tenno are basically space ninjas you\\'d expect them to be able to pull of some acrobatics, and youd be right, its almost impossible to go anywhere without pulling off a little parkour in some of the missions. Now we come to the characters themselves, the Warframes, these are robotic suits-ish that the Tenno control and complete missions with, now theres actually a large amount of these ranging from healing ones, to defensive ones, stealthy ones, and aggressive one, each one coming with its own unique set of abilities, stats and look. There are no real \"Good\" Warframes as they are all good in there own way and who am i to tell you how to play your game. So just go out, find one that you like, and have fun.\\nSo the fact that Warframe is a free game might put you off, and yes even though warframe has a currency that is obtained by paying real money, but that does not mean this game is Pay To Win, this is because you are allowed to freely trade said currency with other players for their items, so if you dont want to use real money but you want an item that you can only get with the currency, then all you need to do is farm for a little bit, and sell of the items you got to players that want them, meaning that every single item can be obtained without having to pay any real money.\\nAll in all I highly reccomend you at least give Warframe a try, I mean, what harm can it do.\\ntl:dr\\nGood game, basic controls, basically 100% free to play, space mums included, check it out',\n",

       " \"Warframe is a fast-paced free to play third person co-op action game.\\nIn this game you operate so-called warframes, basically space ninjas with special abilities. You parkour all over the place, completing your objectives while killing bad guys in a multitude of ways. It's fun.\\nThe first thing you'll realize when you get the hang of Warframe is that there's a lot of content available. Mainly because the game has been getting frequent hotfixes and an impressive amount of major content updates since its release date. Secondly because the game doesn't shy away from complexity. Warframe is surprisingly in-depth. \\nIt's difficult to give an unambiguous description of the core gameplay. You generally go from planet to planet completing levels and quests while collecting resources to craft your arsenal and mods that make your character, weapons and companions stronger. A big part of the game is crafting equipment and leveling it up. The first time you level a piece of equipment up to the level cap, you'll gain Mastery Points. These level up your Mastery Rank. The Mastery Rank is an indicator of one's experience with the game. In essence, it's your account level. A higher MR means you'll be regarded as a more seasoned player. This incentivizes switching up your loadout as you progress through the game, leveling everything to the level cap at least once. This keeps things fresh. However, you don't have to switch up your equipment, if you don't want to. You could also stick with a certain setup and increase its effectiveness in certain areas through resetting its level, which indirectly increases the amount of mods you can install. What separates Warframe from others in the same genre is the choices it gives you when it comes to your playstyle and progression.\\nYou can blindly progress through the game if you want to, or you can invest time into knowing how the damage system works and mod your equipment to take advantage of it. The way damage and modding works heavily rewards the player for taking the time to understand the ins and outs of its mechanics. \\nOnce you have a certain build in mind, or you just want a specific weapon, warframe or companion, you'll have to start farming to get the stuff you need for it. This can be quite a grindfest, but fortunately this is something Warframe really nailed. The grind never feels unfair. It doesn't take a stupid amount of time to get what you want in this game. Sometimes you'll even end up with more things than you need, which you can sell or use later. Admittedly, from an outsider's perspective, this game just looks like a boring grind. However, the fast-paced action-focused gameplay, combined with the satisfaction of building your arsenal, more than makes up for it. This doesn't mean everyone will like it. If you hate grinding, you'll hate this game, regardless of the gameplay.\\nOf course, because Warframe is a free to play title, you also have the option to immediately acquire items in the game with real money. The game's premium currency, called Platinum, can be used to outright buy the items you want from the in-game store. Fortunately, the business model is another thing Warframe really nailed. If you have the time to grind, you're much better off doing that. As mentioned earlier: the grind never feels unfair. You never feel like you're being forced to spend real money on the game. If you don't have a lot of free time, you can just buy Platinum or Prime Access and get true value for your money. Furthermore, Platinum can be traded. This means the players can just trade items for the premium currency to buy stuff from the in-game store without spending a penny.\\nIn short: If you like action games and don't mind grinding, you should definitely try this one out.\",\n",

       " 'There is only one thing you need to know about Warframe: It\\'s free.\\nOh, maybe I didn\\'t make myself clear enough. When I say that Warframe is free, I mean, literally speaking, it is free. Still not clear enough? Alright, I\\'ll elaborate. Apart from two different types of items - appearance items (such as skins and coloring pallets) and weapon/Warframe slots - it is possible for all players to access almost all types of in game items and entities (apart from a few that are no longer available to everyone). In this manner, it is possible for you to obtain every Warframes (characters or so to speak), every weapons, every non-visual-based items and the likes. Of course, there are conditions to fulfill, and obtaining everything will most likely take up a good portion of your time (isn\\'t this what you are looking for?), but the point is, it is perfectly possible to play Warframe in the long run without paying a single cent. It\\'s your choice. \\nSo, what is Warframe? In this game, you are basically a character known as \"Tenno\" who fights battles within a futuristic solar system. You will be teaming up with 3 other Tennos (this is a 4 player co-op game) to complete missions laid out by Lotus, a female commander issuing you orders. Nah, she is nicer than your ex-girlfriend, so don\\'t worry about that. \\nYou will basically be facing three separate forces, Grineer, Corpus and the Infestation (think of the three races in Starcraft if you want to get a better idea). There are different types of missions, ranging from elimination, rescue, spy, to defense and rescue. As for weapons, basically you get to equip a primary weapon (rifle, shotgun, sniper and many others that are hard to categorize), a secondary weapon (categorization is hard for this as well) and a melee weapon (sword, mace, fist... you know the deal). As for your character, you will be using one out of the somewhat 10-ish (slightly less than 20, though the number is gradually increasing as more update comes by) Warframes. Each Warframe comes with different stats, such as self-repairing shields, like those in halo, health, energy (mana) and speed. Still, more importantly, each Warframe has its own unique set of 4 skills. These skills are great assets for the players as most of the times they will come in handy. One thing to note is that gender is preset, so those transsexuals don\\'t have to fake their gender anymore, which is, well ... you decide if it\\'s good or not. There are also mods (modifications) that you can insert into your weapons and Warframes to make them much stronger than they originally are. \\nOh and there are parkour. Learn how to press \"WASD\" + \"LShift\" + \"LCtrl\" + \"Space\" in fluid coordination. It will be helpful and painful, but you will definitely need them.\\nSimple?\\nUnlike many co-op shooters, Warframe definitely has its merits. One of the most apparent distinction of the game is that it has a leveling system that can be found in most MMOs. You can level up both your weapons and Warframes to a maximum rank of 30. Moreover, you can rank up your mods as well to make them more powerful. In this way, Warframe won\\'t be a simple \"run-shoot-kill see-score go-sleep\" type of game. Never. There are things more important than that.\\nAnother merit of Warframe is that there are frequent updates. When I say frequent, I mean FREQUENT, as in one big update per month or so. There will be new game modes, Warframes, weapons, mods ... etc. I mean, come on, who thinks that L4D2 came too fast after L4D1 is released? I do. Who is still waiting for L4D3 after all these years? I am. Who thinks that Gabe Newell should fulfill the unsaid promise of completing the trilogies of Valve games? I do. Come on, we have been waiting for L4D3 and Portal 3 and HL3, and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of waiting. This won\\'t happen for Warframe though. The game has a gradual and comfortable pace of updating. You get new contents every now and then, and they usually blends well with the game. Usually.\\nStill, like most games, there are pros and cons of Warframe and I have to sincerely admit that there are shortcomings with this game when compared to other games. One major shortcoming (I won\\'t say flaw) of this game is that it lacks a concrete story line. Apart from some trivial storytelling, there really aren\\'t much of a tale going on. There are stories told, I\\'m not saying there aren\\'t, but they are rather weak. I know, that is not their aim, and that is not really the point of Warframe, but compared to the rich (though monotonous) storyline of L4D and Portal, Warframe needs to good a better job here.\\nAlso, the game can be rather repetitive. You know, this applies for most Coop shooters, so there really isn\\'t much to say about this. Yeah, repetitive. \\nSo, in general, try Warframe. It\\'s free. If you don\\'t like it, drop it. Simple as that. If you do like it and if you feel that you will be playing it in the long run (like how I felt after my first 100th hours), do consider buying a little platinum to expand your weapon and Warframe slots. I bought like 19.90 USD worth of platinums. Not much, but it is the spirit that counts, right?',\n",
       " 'Warframe has come a long way from when i first started playing, but i can honestly say the majority of it was great! Let me start by describing what warframe is. Its an over the shoulder third-person shooter where you play the role of a ninja warrior in space. The solar system is in chaos, and it\\'s up to you to maintain the balance. With many weapon types to choose from, and different frames to use to suit your playstyle, the possibilities are endless. However there are certain strategies in higher level missions that even veteran players will tell you work. It\\'s pretty much an MMO at this point, so certain \"classes\" of warframes work better at farming resources on certain missions. The developers also release new content as operations to introduce the new features, for example, the newest addition was corpus dropships that drop squads of enemies into battle. It was introduced as Operation: Ambulas Reborn, which featured a reworked boss that dropped in from the ship with a squad of regular enemies. There were a few bugs at first, but the incredibly awesome support team was very quick to respond to reports and get back within 24-48 hours. All in all, this has become one of the best free to play games i have ever played, and the graphics do an excellent job of immersing you in a living, breathing world that is constantly changing. I have to say that there are certain aspects of the game which require you to pay for features. Such as certain weapons, cosmetic packs, etc. Other than that, if you work hard and spend a decent amount of time on it, everything important is attainable without paying money for it. I do encourage you to support the developers by buying things that you may like, but only at your own discretion. Speaking of which, there is also a thriving market for the ingame currency, platinum, where you can spend platinum to buy parts, weapon mods, and other hard to obtain aspects from other players, as well as selling your own parts and mods to other players to obtain platinum. The prices will indeed vary on the rarity of what you are trying to get, but there is also sites and a wiki for any questions you may have about said things. All in all i have had a great experience with this game, rather than reading my long-winded review about the game, why not try it yourself? It\\'s free! Also feel free to add me ingame and i will do my best to be as helpful as possible, my name is Mix_Masterson. See you on the battlefield, and have fun!',\n",

This means that if you play poorly and rely heavily on the end mission reward instead of doing stuff in the actual missions, you will need to grind more, so the less effort the more punished you will be, this is a common issue that leads to complaining and it's usually the player's fault.\\nThe players get more wacky and random as you progress as each player has his/her own definition of efficiency, initially you might be paired with players that have the same warframe and weapons as you, but later on a team is just as creative and cool to play with as the next 1000 missions that follow, so the game tries to keep things fresh, enviroments different and the gameplay fun.\\nIt really all comes down to what you want to do in the game, but do not expect no grind if you want to collect 20 frames and all the weapons, many users complain when in reality it's their fault.\\nThe game is really hard to balance, digital extremes does make an effort to try and keep the grind reasonable, for someone playing once a week this is an issue, but for someone playing daily, it doesn't take much time to get the new desired content and so the developers either introduce new grinding mechanics (that puts everyone on the same playing field for some time) or they introduce new resources, if they simply release something and use old resources or old mechanics, there will always be someone who can do that weapon instantly, no grinding required because it has been done in the past.\\nHowever, they have introduced many systems already and the game is becoming a bit overwelming on that aspect, to many currencies (ducats, credits, platinum,void traces,...), things to lvl up (focus, sindicates, warframe, weapons, mods) can also be a problem.\\nAt some point they will need to stop and need to polish what they currently have without making the playerbase wait months.\\nSo the game becomes super simple and easy for heavy and hardcore players, but super grindy for someone playing 1 mission a week, if that's the case then it is recomended that you lower your expectations on the time required to get a single warframe and that you create a more reasonable objective, do not aim to collect everything and then complain about lack of time to do it.\\nMusic is superb, graphics are great and the game compatible with legacy hardware and OS (like direct x9 graphic cards, windows xp,....) and the gameplay is super enjoyable.\\nThe downsides?\\n - for starters, prime access cost is the price of a tripple A game and this happens every 3 months for some discounted platinum, warframe, weapon and cosmetics.\\nThe game offers exceptional value for it's cost (free) but then has these unique cosmetics that are in a bundle that costs 60$, a single cosmetic and a few boosters for that price is a terrible value.\\n - tennogen item costs are absurd, 6€ for a single skin? no platinum cost, if it was a platinum cost then those trading would be rewarded for it, but by having it tied to steam things get problematic.\\n - Many bugs, especially client and host related bugs, it happens in pretty much every update, where colors, mechanics and features work greatly as the host, but quickly fall appart when you are the client, yes the game is p2p.\\nThings that worked well before end up breaking in the most insane ways possible, this happens in every game with updates, but in warframe it's just silly the ammount of things that stop working after a single big update.\\nSome updates are clearly rushed and the end result is atrocious sometimes.\\n - Regrind aspect, sometimes you will be regrinding for the same content, DE certainly doesn't like you to upgrade existing content, they prefer making you play again to lvl up something new that makes the old obsolete, for example you get the dera weapon but there is a different weapon called dera vandal, making the regular dera rather obsolete if your goal isn't mastery.\\nOverall a great game, a great free to play game, very friendly aproach on the f2p genre, DE is a bit on the greedy side of things but considering i can do anything in the game and the most i have payed in the game ends up being a 6€ skin, i believe the value beats any other game that i have played.\\nThe income for digital extremes comes mainly from the players that purchase plat and they often make bundles (like prime access) so that players feel inclided into buying the cosmetics, but if you only care about player quality, your own gameplay, then the game can offer that and charges nothing.\\nYou can essentially be the best warframe player outthere, do any mission you like, play the way you like and in the end not pay for anything.\",\n",

Remember: As a non early access baker you have to pay 60 bugs to experience the same fun time!\\nDownsides of ARK if you want to experience the game on Official PVP servers:\\n- Not enough new servers for each game-mode.\\n- Cross-ARK-Travel makes it easy for an established Alpha-Tribe to dominate more than one server. No new players get a fair chance if they have missed the early phase. Newcomers are being bullied and harvested for their resources.\\n- The Duping-Exploit on Officials was made harder, but not impossible (AFAIK).\\n- Still no offline raid protection for the new official servers.\\n- Still extremely unbalanced Attack-Defense-Effort: You have worked 4 weeks on your base? Too bad, it can be raided within 2 hours. Turrets being able to target mounted players make it a bit less unfair now though.\\n- Still extremely bad FPS in large Bases.\\nAnyway, my recent advice is still valid:\\nDo NOT play this game on any of the official Servers if\\n1. you are playing alone most of the time,\\n2. you like to do PVE,\\n3. you only like to play occasionally (or you just don't have the time to play 24/7),\\n4. finding and keeping rare loot and taming/breeding creatures means a lot to you,\\n5. you don't want to do deal with aggressive (mega) tribes/players who pick on you constantly and destroy your work with cheap tactics while you are asleep.\\nThis game doesn't reward hard work in terms of giant bases, giant fences or hordes of tamed creatures. You are NEVER safe, especially when you're offline. The longer your offline times are, the greater the risk of loosing all your work. Griefers will have it easy to find and choose one of the many possible weakspots of your bases or just do the easiest thing: drain your turrets while you're offline.\\nInstead: Choose a friendly inofficial server with offline protection and admins who actually care.\\nTrust me.\\nOfficial PVP is not worth your time and nerves if you're not in a huge (and I mean HUGE) tribe.\",\n",

       " \"When I first tried out Warframe I didn't know what to expect. At first glance it didn't seem like much, but after getting into it I realized there's much more to it than I initially thought. I'll list the pros and cons about the game, based on my experience. Don't take this review for granted, its only my opinion after all.\\n- Plenty of frames to choose and play with: \\nwarframes or frames for short are what you play as in the game. Each frame has its own playstyle and set of unique abilities that you can choose from that you can then further customize based on your needs.\\n- A variety of game modes to mix up the gameplay:\\nThese are sufficient in quantity and have different objectives. In Defense you protect an artifact from the enemies, in Survival you simply survive for as long as you can, in Spy you must retrieve data from vaults, and so on.\\n- Huge selection of weapons to use:\\nThere's everything from simple weapons like knives and bows, to assault rifles and grenade launchers, as well as high tech energy weapons. There's enough to choose from to satisfy almost any playstyle.\\n- Mods:\\nAs you play you find various mods that you can use to improve and model your frames and weapons the way you want. Everything from basic health and damage increasing mods to complex mods that give you certain effects when hitting or killing an enemy in a specific way. There's also mods that give your frames useful passive abilities, as well as mods made specifically for a certain frame.\\n- Primes: Prime weapons, frames or mods are better versions of their original counterparts. The regular versions function well enough that the power gap isn't too big, so you don't need a prime to be good at the game.\\n- Freedom of customization:\\nWant a bow that shoots exploding arrows and causes electricity damage? Ever thought of trying out an assault rifle that shoots freezing bullets? Wondered how a pistol that causes radiation and corrosion is like? The game told me I can do all of that and much more!\\n- Freedom of playing the way you want:\\nA friend asked what sets of weapons frames have. He asked if a stealth frame has a bow and a dagger. I responded by taking a squishy little stealth frame into a Defense mission, chopped up the first squad of enemies with a giant two handed sword, killed the 2nd squad with a radiation spewing handgun then blew the remaining squads up with a grenade launcher. And the game was okay with that, you can put any weapon on any frame you want.\\n- The game is F2P (Free to play):\\nThis of course means that you try it out, play it for a bit and then decide if you like it or not. Almost all of the game's content is free. The devs are also pretty generous, often giving players events where they can acquire upgrading components for weapons/frames, special weapons and sometimes even cosmetics, completely for free.\\n- Trading:\\nYou can trade some (but not all) of the items you find in Warframe with other players. The game has its own trading chat to help you find what you're looking for, and there are filters to make searching even easier. You can even make platinum (the game's premium currency) by selling items you can get simply by playing the game.\\n- The community:\\nWarframe has one of the friendliest communities I ever saw in a video game. Players help each other out, veteran and new alike. New players have no problem getting advice when they need it, and even help in missions they can't complete on their own. Sure you might meet a toxic player every now and then, but every game has a few of those bad apples.\\n- Clans:\\nSmall to large groups of players that you can also become a part of. There are a huge amount of clans in Warframe, and you can make your own too if you want. Joining a clan gives you access to more weapons and some other useful items, as well as your own dojo where you can hang out in, or trade.\\n- Cosmetics:\\nThe game offers you a beautiful selection of colors to paint your warframe and your weapons with, as well as various attachments you can use from syandanas, shoulder and legs pads, chest plates and sugatras. Skins are also available. Most of these cost platinum, but that can easily be acquired through trading without having to spend a single penny. For those who wish to support the game and buy platinum, its easily affordable with coupons you can get from daily rewards. The cosmetics themselves aren't that expensive either.\\n- PvP:\\nWhile Warframe is mainly a PVE game, a PvP mode called Conclave is also available where you can fight against other players.\\n- Very grind heavy: Yes you can get almost all of the game's items for free by playing. No you won't get them all easily and/or quickly unless you're the god of luck. Grinding for resources, weapon/frame parts and mods can take up a lot of your time depending what you want. And that's just the start, because...\\n- RNG:\\nTied directly together with grinding. Only a few items in the game are a guaranteed drop, and for everything else you're at the mercy of a random number generator. You can get your item on the first try, or you can be there for a hundred missions and still have nothing. This applies to resources and mods, as well as parts for weapons and warframes. You'll always get something, but chances are it won't be what you want and/or need.\\nSometimes you'll even need to make a key/cypher/some other item to access the mission (for example the recent Razorback event) which costs resources, making it that more frustrating if you can't get the items you want.\\n- Levels and tilesets:\\nDon't get me wrong, they're pretty to look at and keep you amused for a good while, but eventually you'll notice you know all of them by memory. That exact same bridge, that same room, that familiar set of stairs you saw in several other different missions. You'll also likely be grinding for your items I mentioned in the exact same level too, over and over again.\\n- Demands dedication:\\nSimply put, if you want the best Warframe has to offer you'll have to play it a lot. New content's constantly coming out, and while that's a good thing if you can't really take longer break if you want to keep up. Combined with the grinding and RNG you have to play pretty regularly.\\n- Time limited special events:\\nWhat's that? You couldn't play the game during the unique event that lasted a few days because of real life stuff, or you couldn't play enough to get all the content it had to offer? Well too bad, kiss those rewards and the event away, because they're not gonna come back anytime soon.\\n- The Prime vault:\\nNew primes come out every once in a while, and when that happens they replace an older set of prime items that are moved into the vault. This basically means you can't farm for them anymore, unless you have relics to access the missions where their parts once dropped, or getting the parts from players who got them before they got vaulted by trading.\\n- Early game is confusing:\\nWhile the game has a tutorial and players are willing to help out new people, the game's amount of content and all the mechanics it has take a while to learn, confusing new players or turning them away from the game. When I started playing I was running around like a headless chicken trying to figure out what to do.\\n- Late game doesn't have much to do:\\nSo you decided to play a lot, testing yourself just how far the game will take you. You got all the available frames, you have an entire arsenal full of all sorts of weapons. You have acquired the best gear the game has to offer. You are now a master of Warframe, you can solo the hardest missions without breaking a sweat, the toughest enemies fall before you like insects, you're always the best player in your squad, you have a mountain of resources stockpiled from how many missions you've completed.\\nAnd then? Then you find you have nothing left to do because you already have everything you need, and you slowly get bored.\",\n",

You might think, just by looking at its store page with the \"Free to Play\" tag and the \"dlc(?)\" packs underneath that it\\'s Pay to Win.\\nThat is not the case. Not even a little bit. You can obtain everything non-cosmetic in the game without paying a dime. You can even trade rare items for the in-game currency, platinum. So you really can get everything without paying.\\nYou start off with little, taking a weapon of choice for a Primary, Secondary and a Melee weapon, as well as one of three Warframes. Your Warframe has certain abilities that set it aside from others. As you master your weapons and Warframe, The Lotus takes notice and allows you to test your abilities and Rank Up.

       " \"My initial impression of Warframe was that someone had made a huge mistake, and I'd received a rather expensive game for free. As it turns out, Warframe IS free. Which is incredible considering the polished graphics, and quality as it's presented.\\nDon't be fooled; Warframe is definitely a time sink. Levelling up a Warframe to use better weapons, to then level them further and unlock better mods for weapons - this cycle continues. There is a serious lack of content aside from the same set of missions. 'Smash 'em up carnage and mindless fun' is a great way to describe the game.\\n- A huge pull, Warframes, weapons, and ships are \\n customisable, and the sheer number of each available is insane. While there are real cash transactions, almost everything in the game can be crafted with some effort on your part, barring cosmetic skins/items. I do feel a little miffed that most colour palletes are also locked behind this paywall. I'm not PSYCHED to be a Red Power Ranger, but guess I will be one unless this changes.\\n- Saying this, the atmosphere and graphics are excellent. It plays and looks fantastic on my GTX1070, with the camera at a third person view, and OTS zooms for scoped or long-range weapons.\\n- Combat feels seamless in singleplayer, I have had no problems except for my own inadequacy with a gun (which is slowly improving.) With multiplayer, I have noticed a significant amount of movement lag.\\n- If you're used to being a long-term clicker, like me, your fingers are probably going to ache after CTRL+ SPACE/SHIFT jumping combos (but you do look hella cool.)\\nThere is a LOT of focus on co-op play, and if you suffer from anxiety as I do, I would suggest playing with friends only or changing settings for solo missions. Unfortunately, my experience of the public community is that it is quite a toxic one. Others may not feel this is the case, but for the majority of the time I've played and spent in public groups, there is a ton of verbal abuse over voice chat/nasty trolls, and as a new player it is -hugely- off-putting.  I have learned of the mute option since, but it feels that the longer a game is released, especially of the MMO variety, and the larger player base it gains, the worse the community gets. [Cue group rushed playthroughs, abuse, stress, panic attacks and not wanting to play again for extended periods of time on my part.]\\nI await the day a majority friendly community lasts in any MMO, but I may as well live in hope of Half-Life 3.\\n*As to the new Plains of Eidolon update; oh man, THE GRIND IS REAL. It feels as though the developers tried to create a rolling, open world landscape for players to explore and complete missions at their leisure, but the missions are really just repetitive bounties that you have to run all the way back and extract to the main hub to complete. That doesn't fit well with an open world setting.\\nRepeatable quests and bounties which are required for reputation gain \\n Feeling forced to grind them for rewards and necessary mats after a relatively 'do whatever you feel kind of vibe,' is odd. It would work well as an increment to a large update, but as the update itself, it feels rather shallow.*\",\n",

Did I say Space Ninjas?  It's really really fun living out your childhood dreams of dropkicking baddies in the face while throwing stars at a secondary target.  If you ever wanted to be Bruce Lee; this is your game.  \\nIt has boss fights with actual strategies, plenty of unlocks to find, lots of socializing for those that want to chit chat as much as kick things in the derriere.  The new weapon damage system gives hardcore mathematicians something to theory craft about, but is as easy as Paper, Rock, Scissors in it's simplest form.  Weapon choice is varied in feel thus you many choices to find the perfect weapons that suit your playstyle.  \\nAlternative playstyles such as Stealth plays a prominent role in Warframe.  You can absolutely wreck targets from the shadows!  You can choose between Support frames, Offensive frames, and Defensive frames for a mission.  Invite your buddies or grab some guys / gals from the recruiting social channel.  If you want to meet new people, join a completely randomized group of 4 players hell bent on conquering space!  \\nYou have multiple saved loadout slots for free!  Digital Extremes doesn't really nickle and dime you in this game like other F2P games.  They do need to make a profit so they sell cosmetic items, XP boosters, warframe slots, weapon slots, and materials for those too busy to go fight.  Nearly everything in the game can be acquired by doing fun events that last nearly a week so you can choose when to partake of them.  They give away the best guns for free during those events.  \\nThey have a XP system that also nets you some of the best guns in the game for just running missions to collect loot and crafting that loot into weapons and warframes.  Leveling up those frames and weapons gives you the XP necessary to unlock the sickest weapons!  This is a Play to Win game where you can buy materials to craft if you are impatient, but you can just play more and get it.  Isn't playing the game the purpose of it?  Of course you can buy completed Warframes for real money, but spending a couple hours of your time you can get the same thing for free.  Of course you still need to buy the inventory slot for that frame to use it.  At less than $1 a slot, no subscription fee, and no initial game purchase, this sounds like the steal of the century.  And you don't have to buy them and still have fun, but it's nice to be able to support the developer for their time and effort.\\nIn short play this now!\",\n",

It is not like you can progress faster just by being a good player, you really have to spend time in grinding and also in waiting. Unless you are willing to spend Platinum (aka real money) to bypass these hidden locks (rush crafting, buying potato, slots etc.).

       " 'This game has a huge amount of potential, and it literally hurts to see it being done in such a bad way, this review will change the moment the major problems like game breaking bugs, optimization, easy dedicated server setup and at least a vague resemblence of balancing enters the game, until then I sadly have to give it a thumbs down.\\nSo, it\\'s been a while since my last review of ARK was out, and this one won\\'t get into as much detail as the last one sadly. Not because I\\'m missing the time, or there are fewer things to talk about, but simply the problem that Steam offers a cap on the length of it, and a proper done one would simply break this limit.\\nAnd before you ask why the heck one can even get so far: Yes, explaining the faults of this game alone takes that long! So I\\'ll try to make it short and into a list:\\nPros:\\n- Nice graphics\\n- Huge amounts of content\\n- Long possible playtime to do everything\\n- Dinosaurs! :p\\n- Riding those dinosaurs!\\n- Rather ok base building (this will be in the con part with a short description why as well)\\n- LOTS and lots of potential for the future.\\n- Active modding community\\n- Steadily added content (Also in the con, wait for it! ;) )\\nCons: (Oh boy, here they come sadly)\\n- The balancing is simply not there, not even closely, it\\'s so bad that you can count it as broken.\\n- Private servers are a chore, not even worth looking at unless you want to have hours of headaches to even set one up, not to speak about keeping it running.\\n- Tribe mechanics are simply broken, while single players need at least a week to level up to get to the interesting parts of the game, a 10-20 people tribe can push you trough the whole month long process of maxing your character in as much as an hour... yes, that broken.\\n- The steadily added content, breaking the balancing even further and implemented often in a way so previous content gets basically... obsolete from a game mechanics standpoint, which is always bad, the game isn\\'t getting richer, just bigger.\\n- Optimisation, don\\'t even get me started on this, one of the points I have to get a bit more in depth:\\nThe rendering isn\\'t finished properly, while wriggling and dancing trees in the distance and lightning mistakes are ok for an early access, it\\'s not only the minor bugs which ruin the gameplay. Many people aren\\'t able to start the game even with proper hardware, the autosaving of the game often causes freezes in the game, not from time to time but even to a point where every 5 seconds a 0,5 second freeze is incoming, imagine playing a single player map like this! Constant framedrops and the ability to look trough the map is a huge problem as well, as is getting stuck in random places and literally having to die to get free again is another. The server migration system is broken and often corrupts your character, making all your progress useless in a second and even dinosaurs you cared for for days or weeks can simply vanish trough the ground, just to loose your favourite one without your doing. And that\\'s just a SMALL portion of the problem.\\n- The building system, it\\'s nice in itself, but tedious. The ground isn\\'t even, so fiddling around to get the part where it belongs to is sometimes a hassle, and even if you manage to do it, the automatic snapping system to make it easier... is only making it harder. Instead of offering a simple button to force the parts to align in different directions it\\'s made by standing in a proper angle towards it, parts often sinking into the ground with no way is seeing where you build, or floating in the air without an option to make it look good. It needs serious overhauling, but that never has even been adressed as of yet.\\nBut, since I don\\'t want to make it too long I\\'ll move on to 2 seperate problems which isn\\'t the game itself, but rather the developers, something which in itself are major things ruining the trust of us consumers, things which should even be forbidden by laws which need to catch up. Well, but what could I mean to warrant such words even?\\n- The DLC is the first. The game is Early Access, and offers a PAID DLC! That in itself is unheard of, and even with the part that the studio has a working force especially dedicated to this, it doesn\\'t tend to go well as a customer. Imagine getting a microwave which burns your food or simply doesn\\'t heat it, a gamble if you would even get something good out of it. Not a company comes and offers you some gimmick for this microwave without even taking care of the faults it already has, adding even more problems to it, would you buy it? No? Didn\\'t think so as well, but that\\'s exactly what they are doing.\\n- And this brings me to the second absolutely disgusting thing to do: Price changes. The game had a former pricetag of 20€, which is a price fitting to the game, after all, it\\'s early access, has a lot of bugs, broken systems, no sort of resemblance of balance but in itself is fun. Well, now we got a lovely 60€ Pricetag, one which is used for RELEASED AAA titles normally, not for a broken heap of chunk trying to imitate a proper done AAA title, and that\\'s just... well... disgusting to see.\\nSo, you can make up your mind on your own if the massive downsides are worth to pay for a sandbox game with broken systems, balancing and even the chance you\\'re not able to play it. Official servers are literally cancer with elite-tribes running around bullying everyone else to keep the servers for themself. The self-made servers taking some sort of degree in IT to even set up properly and singleplayer not even offering you the chance to do everything as the engram system forces you to decide ahead of time... which is impossible with your first character.\\nTo end it I\\'ll say a few words about the developers: Don\\'t trust them even a single bit, they are talking about optimizing the game since over a year, with only minor changes coming out while the mass of updates are new (often broken) content which can\\'t be enjoyed after mentioning the myriad of problems surrounding the game. Their focus is off of what can be called proper game development, they milk the community for money in places where they shouldn\\'t and their most common things said to alleviate that is the mass of content we get for free. Wake up thought! Don\\'t blindly run into it thinking \"Wow, they are offering free content, not everyone does that!\" And yeah, you\\'re right! BUT! If a company brings you broken stuff, you think that some sort of compensation is needed after it for all the hassly they put you trough, it\\'s the same here. They simply give you free stuff so you keep being a customer and add a good review despite their messed up game and development focus.\\nIf you\\'ve already bought the game... well, hard to change that, but if you\\'re someone who is vague about buying it... please please don\\'t do it! Doing so only strenghtens their views that they can get away with this sort of thing, making it harder in the future for us consumers to get a proper product as other companies will follow their footsteps, releasing broken junk which will frustrate you sooner or later instead of being a good game.\\nThere are several other sandbox games out there, some running since years, older, with clunky UI\\'s, worse graphics and other focus, rather take one of those instead of this pile of unfinished junk, you\\'ll have a better time with RUST, Wurm Unlimited or some others out there.',\n",

So say what you will about the serves being full on a great game, or say what you will about lazy devs who dropped 3 minor patches on a dime to keep the game from exploding.

       " 'Warframe is a free to play TPS / hack \\'n slash co-op game with stealth and parkour elements. In it the player becomes one of the Tenno, space ninjas awakened from a long slumber, who control powerful suits known as Warframes which provide different abilities and allow them to tackle on dangerous jobs from Lotus.\\nThe graphics are just incredible. Each location has its own design style, the environments are shiny and rich in details, while the special effects are just plain beautiful. The only downside might be the fact that the last one can be a little bit too distracting at times and hard to see through during a fight.\\nIn the sound department, the music is appriopriate to the situation (speeds up when in a fight, for example) and whatever plays in the background is usually the theme of the faction you\\'re fighting against (though it can get overriden by the boss\\' theme if someone like that appears). A few of the tracks deserve a mention for being just plain incredible, such as Drums of War, Becoming the Hunted, Cold and Gold, We Are Not Alone, Reap What You Sow and \\n. The sound effects aren\\'t anything special, but they are diverse enough to not get boring or tiring. The voice acting is also really good, even if a bit scarce.\\nThe gameplay consists of you and up to three other players deploying on a mission and completing a specific objective (like killing all enemies or capturing important targets) while moving through randomly-generated rooms. You get to use between three weapons - primary, secondary and melee (which can be of many different types, like bows, shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, pistols, shurikens, kunais, swords, axes, hammers, polearms, scythes, glaives, knuckles, gunblades.. yeah, this game has \\n of weapons) - as well as an assortment of movement options, including, but not limited to sprinting, sliding, wall-running etc. You can also attack enemies while performing any of those maneuvers, giving you a large degree of freedom as to how and when to move in and strike.\\nAs far as stealth elements go, you can obviously use cover to keep yourself out of sight of enemies. You can also use silent weapons like bows and shurikens to take them out from a distance, or sneak up behind them and perform an insta-kill stealth execution. Some abilities can also make you invisible or silence everything within a certain radius. The mechanics are very solid and it\\'s fun slicing stuff down.\\nThere is also the Archwing and its own missions, where you move in no-gravity using the eponymous mechanical wings, shooting down foes akin to a space shooter. While it isn\\'t as diverse as the standard gamemode, it is a good change of pace from time to time. Not to mention, even more awesome.\\nThe amount of equipment, types of environments, and missions you can encounter is staggering. The diversity is what keeps it from getting too stale.\\nAnother good thing is that the multiplayer functions pretty well - even with high ping, you will notice an obvious delay, but it won\\'t impact your experience or general gameplay as much as in some other games.\\nStory-wise, the game isn\\'t really all that rich, but it is solid nonetheless. There is a lot of lore in transcripts and descriptions of some weapons and Warframes, and the quests also provide an interesting narrative as far as the identity of Lotus and the Tenno themselves goes, as well as what happened in the past and what the player characters did before they were put to cryosleep. I\\'m not going to be spoiling anything, as you should discover it yourself, particularly when it comes to the newest Second Dream quest.\\nI think this is it for the pros, so let\\'s start counting out the cons. The game is still, quite obviously, a glorified grind to get better stuff. Fortunately, most of the time it\\'s somewhat fun to play.\\nSpeaking about multiplayer, if the host\\'s computer lags horribly due to all the stuff going on in the game, you can expect your gameplay to be similarly laggy, with everything \"flash stepping\" all over the place.\\nAnother bad thing is the fact that enemies are pretty stupid sometimes. They tend to take cover at not exactly the best spots, or forget that you just sped right past them and still sit there waiting in cover, just being covered from the wrong direction. Harder missions only strengthen the enemies\\' stats together with spawning elites more often, and sometimes new types of enemies.\\nAlso another thing is that the game requires a LOT of grinding to even get moderately powerful. At the beginning you\\'re going to struggle to complete the missions that aren\\'t the absolute simplest of all, since you don\\'t have much resources to manufacture new stuff, and the starting equipment is very weak. And even if you do get strong weapons, they\\'re not going to be powerful enough without a good assortment of high-rank mods for them to customize their damage output. Of course, if you have a friend who\\'s been playing the game for quite some time and is willing to help you out in getting started, this becomes a bit less of an issue.\\nThe amount of slots you get for equipment is also very limited. While it isn\\'t so bad with weapon and sentinel slots, you get only two Warframe slots for starters, kind of limiting your options as to how many roles you can fill in a team. You really need more slots to be able to do something besides one or two things.\\nThe last thing is the fact that the game is pretty glitchy. Objects can spawn at wrong places due to random generator just messing up, or you can land outside the map and fall into the Void to a collision detection glitch or a lag spike. And this isn\\'t an uncommon occurence.\\nOverall, this is a grindy and harsh at the beginning, but very fun game once you get far enough. You should check it out if you don\\'t mind a sluggish beginning, especially if you\\'ve got more experienced friends who can help you get running.',\n",

       " 'Caution: Overly detailed, so I am very sorry\\n      So I\\'ve been playing this game for about 3 years now, and this has easily become one of my most played games that I own. Not even exclusive to steam. Warframe is a game that takes place in space, where you take control of a \\'Tenno\\', which is the faction/race of everyone else that plays. What is a Tenno? Well... play for yourself, and you\\'ll find out with time. -wink-\\n\"What is a Warframe?\"\\n      Warframes are the battle-suits that you control. You walk as them, you fight as them, you hang out as them...you pretty much ARE the Warframe. (Yes, I told you that you are a Tenno as well. Like I said, it\\'s just a suit. It\\'s complicated.) There are currently 29 different Warframes to collect/build and use, each with their own unique set of flashy abilities. I say \\'currently\\' because the development team behind this game are constantly working on it and sending out updates (also, one of the most enjoyable development teams I\\'ve ever seen, tbh), and the community helps shape the game greatly. \\n      Anyhow, the Warframes are battle-suits for a reason. In this game, you are a freaking ninja, in probably the most ninja way possible. From wall jumps, slides, air-kicks, backflips, gliding, rolling, super jumps, throwing stars, dual daggers, etc.. You name it, it\\'s probably possible. There is so much movement and control, you can fly through areas like a breeze if you get the hang of the movement system. There is also so much customization in this game. Assault rifles, rocket launchers, bows, crossbows, sniper rifles, shotguns, laser-beams, sawblade launchers, wormhole creators, grenade launchers, laser cannons, lightning shooters, gas cloud launchers, laser-rifles, infested growth that shoots bullets and grappling hooks, freeze-rays, and much more. Also, most of what I just listed are primary weapons, meaning you ALSO have secondary weapons, which are your sidearms, and melee weapons. There are an equal amount of interesting categories for sidearms, but if you are an in-your-face type of player, then enjoy your collection of melee weapons, including single swords, dual swords, katanas, daggers, glaives, bo staffs, polearms, hammers, axes, whips, whip/blade combos, energy-blades--well, you get the point by now. There are many skins for your weapons and your warframes as well. Another thing that heavily affects customization is the fact that you can color anything that you own, from warframes, weapons, companions (little robotic fellows that float behind you with their own supportive abilities..or, you know, a cat or a dog.), armor pieces and scarfs (this game is called Fashionframe by the community for a reason), and even your own ship.\\n      Your ship serves as your personal hub, where you can access the star chart for missions, your arsenal, your foundry (for building weapons, warframes, gear, and everything else), your mods, and more. What are mods? Mods are these little cards that drop from enemies in the game, some mods being specific to certain enemies. They also have tiers of rarity. Anyway, mods are a very important feature, and are used for upgrading your warframes and weapons. There are hundreds of different mods, ranging from additional health percentages, additional damage, elemental damage (which you can mix different elements to form new elements, might I add), ability range, and just...pretty much anything you need to help you progress and spice up the gameplay a bit more. Want a silenced loadout for stealth? There are mods for that. Screw stealth, you want explosions? Mods.\\n\"Who are the bad guys?\"\\n      There are a handful of different factions in the game, mostly all of them against the Tenno. \\nThere are the Grineer, who are crude, ugly, bulky clones of other Grineer, made to produce a massive army. Usually found in their battleships, or their own settlements, destroying the planet\\'s landscape with machinery. They look dumb, but can be pretty tough.\\n      Another faction is the Corpus, who are driven by greed. They are more technologically advanced than the Grineer, using robotics, drones, and lasers in their favor. \\n      The Infested is another faction. They are...a bit of a mess. Disgusting heaps and masses of flesh, screeching as they charge to attack. They are basically zombified, destroyed forms of Grineer and Corpus, but you really don\\'t see them that way, considering how mutilated they become. They don\\'t have much of a role other than to spread the virus, and, most importantly, kill you.\\n      There are a couple of other factions, but they are a bit spoiler-y, so I\\'ll avoid talking about them.\\n\"Why are we doing any of this in the first place?\"\\n      Because Space-mom tells you to, and you must listen to Space-mom.\\n\"....who tf is space-mom?\"\\n      Upon the Tenno\\'s awakening, you are contacted by a mysterious woman by the name of Lotus, who first appears to be an AI of sorts, although taking a humanoid form. You have no memory of anything before this \\'awakening\\', so you should probably listen to her.\\n      She guides and cares for the entire Tenno faction, alerting them of dangers and important events happening throughout the solar system. She is your leader.\\n\"So what is the main objective, overall?\" +bonus info i dont know where to fit otherwise\\n      Really, it\\'s anything you want. A lot of players get lost because they don\\'t know what they should be doing, but you are just supposed to make your own personal missions, which you can invite friends to. Also, this is a very heavy co-op based game, so have as much fun as you want with up to 4 players in a squad (or up to 8 in raid missions). You can play this game completely solo if you want, of course. It will be pretty challenging, though.\\n      So let\\'s start from a new players point-of-view. You have unlocked your first planet. You can continue to do the mission-nodes that it has to offer, all the way up to the planet boss. Each planet also has a newly-added feature, which are known as Junctions. Junctions are what players have to go through to get to the next planet, and will offer a variety of trials before passage. Upon completing a Junction, you are rewarded with a few things, such as blueprints for weapons, a few parts for building a few specific warframes, and they will unlock quests. Quests are side-things that you can do, which also give you some rewards. There are a handful of warframes that are quest-exclusive if you want to obtain them, as well as some helpful items to assist you along the way. Another recent addition (as in since December) are Cinematic Quests. These are main story-related quests that have cutscenes, and usually have a lot to reveal about the lore, and will unlock some other nice things (You still have to unlock these quests from Junctions, or even just through the market.) The in-game market shows mostly all of everything you can get in the game. The best part? You can get most of this for free! Of course you can add money to just BUY weapons, warframes, gear, companions, etc., and gain access to them immediately, but this is not a pay-to-win game. Not at all. It\\'s more of a \\'pay-to-progress-faster\\' game. However, building these things by yourself without paying any real currency can be a fun time-consuming process. The word Fun can be taken literally or sarcastically in this subject, depending on what the building requirements are, for what you are making. You gather resources to build and complete these things from different planets throughout the solar system, each having their own set of different resources. They drop from enemies, loot lockers, and storage containers (there is even a warframe that increases loot drops, while simutaneously punching souls and raising the dead!). Also, you can earn the real-money currency in this game by trading with other players. I\\'m out of space at this point, but all I have to say is I wish more of my friends could get into this.',\n",

       " 'I find myself in a rather strange position with Warframe. Normally, with a FOP game I immediately come into the game with ill feeling on the grounds that most of their kind are not consumer friendly, and are devised to extort as much money from the player as possible. However, if one is wise to the internet community at all, one will have noticed the general feeling towards this game has always been rather favorable. The developers, despite some rather hefty resource requirements (The Hema\\'s building schematic, for example, is insane, and designed to produce frustration to make people buy it outright) will usually be attainable easily enough. \\nSecondly, I would also like to preface the fact that this game is constantly changing and being updated. Nerfs, bug fixes, new weapons and Frames, and the like are constantly being added to the game. Hence, discussing the micro scales subtitles is almost useless as its subject to change. With that said, on with the review.\\nAt first you might find the movement in Warframe clumsy and \\'floaty\\'. You\\'ll soon get used to it, I found myself diving through small holes in the environment and shooting peoples while flying through the air in a matter of hours. A caveat however, is that you will find the quickest way to traverse the environment is to the [Slide+jump+role] maneuver, and repeat it forever. This looks slightly strange when you see everyone (including yourself) pirouetting through the mission, but it gets you from A to B quick. \\nThe combat however is great. Most weapons feel distinct with their own personality and a wealth of mods and extra do-hikkys to add onto them. Most weapons have significant punch to them, the shotguns especially, but some, the pistols especially, seem to mere pee-shooters in comparison to their larger primary-arm. Melee is also great (As of \"Combat.20).Most weapons have combo\\'s to pull off, or you can simply mash the E button and turn your enemies to pulp, but more importantly, you\\'ll still look good while doing it.\\nYou sensing a theme here?\\nYes. This game is made to forfill your deepest power fantasy. While the games \"End game\" Sorties are high enough level to cause you some discomfort, most of the game is a breeze. The completionist aspect will keep you coming back again and again, if you\\'re of the inclination to enjoy that sort of game however.\\nIts ok. \\nNot the best thing about the game by a long shot. Soundtrack is background filler at best. Some OST\\'s are ok, but rarely intrude onto the on-screen carnage. Weapon sounds however, do a good job of conferring the heavy crunches and meaty explosions of some truly ridiculous firearms exploded your foes into bloody giblets. \\nThis section will of the review will be more subjective that the others, purely on the grounds that some will not have such a tolerance for the grind as some.  With that said, I did not find the grind in this game to be overly-intrusive. If you set your mind to it there is nothing in the game you cannot grind out in a matter of hours (Apart from some late game Prime parts). Most resources are easily obtainable, but a certain amount of RNG is involved. Each planet you visit will indicate what kind of resource you can expect to find, but I would advise looking up the drop-tables just for ease of life. \\nIn many ways, Warframe sets the frame work for all \\'Free to Play\\' games. Satisfying gameplay loop, with reasonable end-game combat. The grind is manageable, and what you don\\'t what to grind for you can buy. The ingame currency might not appeal to you on the grounds that things appear ludicrously expensive. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING UNTIL YOU HAVE THE 75% OFF COUPON CODE (It drops on the daily login reward). That makes the most expensive ingame currency package (something like £130) into a more managed £35; a reasonable price considering that gains you about 4500 platinum, which will last you for a long-long time. \\nIf you\\'re looking to sink some time into a great game, which just so happens to be almost free, you\\'d might as well choose this one.',\n",

Latency issues and high system requirements can put off many but its free to play model is fair. All of the content is provided to players free of charge and that makes it difficult not to recommend it to everyone. \\nYou assume the role of one of the Tenno; an ancient group of warriors that were placed in cryogenic stasis in order to survive a losing war.Your character then awakens to find the solar system in extreme turmoil. Caught in a war between three major factions and being the only ones able to disrupt the stalemate, they soon attract attention.

Enemies will drop many modifications during missions, which allow players to change weaponry and their character to improve combat performance without limitation. This design allows players to modify all of the smallest aspects of their character and weaponry while maintaining the game’s RPG elements. Each of the weapons have their own specific function, attack patterns and style, which further compliment your playstyle. Dying can come across as cheap as some enemies will stun lock players to death or simply hit through their shields for an instant-kill. Included to increase difficulty; it often feels unjustified and overly punishing.\\nMission maps are generated randomly based on pre-existing tile sets depending on the planet and type of mission chosen. Each mission has a specific objective, however many of these feel overly similar; often consisting of back tracking and repetitive fetch quests.  Missions are unlocked by completing the adjacent nodes connected to them; however this soon branches off into many directions, though many of these use the same tile-sets as the previous mission with only a few varying objectives between the two. Missions can often feel too similar to one another on a single planet, giving little reason to play ones that branch away from the main path.\\nThe matchmaking system can be frustrating, offering little choice in terms of selecting a mission or joining a game already in progress. Offering no options besides public or private, you may often find yourself leaving a laggy game only to be thrown back in again numerous times. The matchmaking system definitely needs work and it’s constantly overlooked throughout updates.\\nWarframe's free to play model uses micro-transactions to speed up the acquisition of weapons and characters with the use of in game currency called platinum. Free users are still able to access all content within the game but will struggle to gain access to everything without consistent farming for materials and parts needed to create new weapons. Platinum allows players to directly purchase weapons and characters without the need to craft and collect materials. With free players able to access all content while giving paying customers faster access to new content, Warframe shows how the free to play model doesn’t have to alienate non-paying users.\\nWhile Warframe doesn't provide the adrenaline fueled action we're accustomed to in shooters, its Shoot-'em-up style combat remains satisfying for many hours and the endless customization options add much needed padding to help overcome the repetition. The heavy reliance on a random loot table for item drops throughout the game can lead to extreme frustration at times, especially when farming for a specific item. Bugs can be prominent at times, especially the ones that affect the user interface, however most major issues are fixed quickly with a hotfix provided by the development team.\\nPros:\\n+ Stunning visuals, especially for more powerful video cards\\n+ Plenty of weapons and characters to level up\\n+ Customization allows any type of design and play-style which adds replay value\\n+ Frequent content updates\\nCons:\\n- Dying can feel unfair at times, leaving the player stun-locked until death\\n- Matchmaking system needs work, often selecting poor hosts\\n- High repetition within missions\\n- High system requirements\\n- Microtransactions are a little overpriced\\nWhile rough around the edges at times, most bugs and technical issues are not persistent. As long as you can meet the system requirements and bandwidth isn't a limitation, there’s no reason not to give Warframe a try with its fair free to play model.\\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out the Analog Reviews steam group where we strive to provide honest and unbiased reviews: \",\n",

       " 'Warframe is a game with a steep grinding requirement that doesn\\'t adhere to skinner box rules. If you don\\'t enjoy heavy grind for progression, or if you are the type that is frustrated or easily bored of repeating content, this game \\n be  a game you enjoy.\\nDespite the intense grind that Warframe requires, the core mechanics and gameplay are incredibly fun. For a free to play game, it looks absolutely \\n and runs exceptionally well; I\\'ve experienced no CTDs or major crashes while playing the game and it is generally well optimised all around.\\nWarframe is a combat focused game centred on fast past action with high player mobility. It\\'s not known as \"ninjas in space\" for no reason. Combat is fluid overall, with a huge variety of weapon types for both primary weapons (shotguns/rifles/snipers primarily) secondary weapons (pistols/thrown weapons) and melee weapons (dual swords/sword&shield/greatsword/hammer and more.) Classes do not exist and are instead replaced by an equally wide variety of frames that can perform a wide variety of abilities, making player loadout customisation vast almost to the point of being intimidating. The combat feels great, and once you find a frame and weapon load out that you enjoy, there\\'s enough of a learning curve still present that allows you to master your chosen loadout to the best effectiveness.\\nLoadout is further customised by modifications you can apply to both frame and weapons, also known as mods, but I praise this system a little less heartily than I praise the actual variety of frames and weapons.\\nThe game boasts a beautiful soundtrack and some stunning cutscenes in the story missions that have been added over the last couple of years, and the story is surprisingly immersive for a game of this style. Speaking as somebody who enjoys lore and story in video games, it was a \\n surprise to play through the Warframe story quests and learn more about the universe that DE have created here; there\\'s a surprising amount of depth to it that lorehounds can dig into and theorycraft about. The voice acting is also surprisingly good, all things considered, although you could also call it a little \"cheesey\" or \"hammy\" in places - a little overdone. Bosses are given notably memorable personalities, in my opinion, and they\\'re fun to \\'interract\\' with. \\nEvents are fairly regular and there are a variety of mission types, although generally the mission types do blend together in places given the combat is the main focal point of the game. Enemy types are also varied, but only really noticeable when you get to end-game content and you learn to prioritise which enemy you should kill first for your own safety; at early levels you won\\'t really notice a difference between different enemies as you cut through them all the same. Different planets are made to feel somewhat unique with varying tilesets, which also gives Warframe the ability to make every mission \\n individual insofar as the layout of your tileset will be randomly generated with every playthrough and you will not learn to route missions more than you will learn to map out each tile in a given set until it becomes second nature navigating through them.\\nBoss fights exist in the game and vary from being somewhat frustrating to being interesting and fun; sadly while I enjoyed almost all boss fights the first couple of times they quickly began to blend together into simple \"special enemies\" that needed a bit of care or a specific loadout to steamroll over. This can be said about much of the Warframe content.\\n1. Although there are hundreds of mods to choose from for frames, weapons and companions, this is actually quite deceitful. While you can modify your loadout in any way you see fit, you will quickly come to learn that specific frames perform to the best of their ability with specific loadouts - and this is the same for weapons and companions. The vast mod system becomes quickly smaller when you realise that certain mods are required for your frame or your weapon and you will always be dedicating one or two slots per frame/weapon/companion for the same one or two mods, without fail.\\nWhile there is still a great deal of customisation to be had, it\\'s quickly apparent that there are some things you will be required or expected to have equipped to your loadout to better your performance.\\n2. Certain frames are simply not as good as other frames. Now this isn\\'t to say you shouldn\\'t play them if you enjoy them; every frame can be played to the endgame and you should play frames that you enjoy. But it is quickly apparent when you start playing with different frames that some just don\\'t offer anything decent, or don\\'t do a job that another frame does not do better. This leaves some frames feeling gimicky or otherwise less fun to play given how less effective they are by comparison, and it certainly can make you feel a little out of place if you choose to play publicly when you take an unconventional frame.\\nFor those who don\\'t care about public opinion, this won\\'t seem like an issue. But, for players who care about efficiency and effectiveness, this is an issue you should likely be aware of before you choose to invest in certain frames.\\n3. Warframe is infamous for its grind. Progression in Warframe does not follow skinner box logic simply because there are very few noticeable changes when ranking up anything from 1 - 30. Aside from frames getting new abilities and getting increased mod capacity across the board, gameplay itself does not feel \\n changed because as you continue to rank up, you play missions designed for higher ranks and thus the game remains the same. There are no notable jumps in power that leave you feeling particularly empowered as a player and, if anything, playing a new weapon or warframe is more satisfying than grinding them to rank 30 simply because they bring you something new to do.\\nFarming for Prime parts - where a Primed version of a frame or a weapon is more powerful than its counterpart - has recently been completely overhauled with a new Relic and Fissure system, where you are required to grind out relics that contain potential Prime parts and then required to complete Fissure missions in order to break them open. Endless missions - a staple of the Warframe \"endgame\" that featured a steadily scaling mission that players with fully ranked and kitted loadouts could challenge themselves with - have been recently \\'reworked\\' to the point of being playable but still requiring a additional relic for every 5 waves, meaning there is still a greater grind for farming Primes than there was previously.\\nMastery Rank is given more attention than it should be given, but it is a requirement to unlock and craft certain weapons, so it is also worth mentioning that you will be required to get and rank multiple frames and weapons to 30 in order to progress your Mastery Rank and unlock further content - which can also mean grinding a weapon to 30 you otherwise hate playing and would never use.\\n4. For a game with so many frames and weapons, the number of slots you have for frames and weapons is hilariously small. Naturally Warframe is free to play and thus there is encouragement to purchase Platinum - the in game currency you buy for real money - so that you can expand your arsenal and have greater access to weapons and frames. While normally I wouldn\\'t chastise this business model, in this case I chastise it simply due to how necessary it winds up being, unless you don\\'t mind being a minimalist and being extremely picky with what you keep and what you sell after you rank it to 30. For hoarders like myself, it\\'s a nightmare.',\n",

The game was horribly optimized then, but it was worth it because it was fun when it did work and you knew that the devs were working on it with the amount of patches being released. They slowed down for a while, which I figured was to prepare for the game's launch (which I believe was originally scheduled in June of this year). Now, however, it's clear that this game has gone from a promising alpha game to another game that has gone from promising game in development to cash grab. I've seen significant performance drops since the desert xpac came out, on top of numerous bugs that had been plaguing the base game before its release. I was really looking forward to this game fully polished, if it was this fun with bugs and performance issues, imagine being able to run it at full quality.

And even before that, they have taken several fan-created Warframes and Weapons and put them into the game today. Some examples of this being the Mios Blade & Whiip, the Silva & Aegis Flame Sword & Shield, and even the Zephyr Warframe.\\nThe Free 2 Play Aspect of this game is an absolute GODSEND, and every single other MMO out there should look at Warframe as a good example of how to do a Free 2 Play MMO done right in a 100% Non-P2W Fashion. Oh, you wanna buy that really powerful gun at such a low rank just to compete with the big boys? TOUGH♥♥♥♥♥♥ scrub!

Of course, you\\'re still ALLOWED to spend moeny on tthe game if you want, but at absolutely no point do you feel like you\\'re being FORCED to do so whatsoever.\\nTired of people in League of Legends and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive telling you how they\\'re going to♥♥♥♥♥♥your mother right in front of you in public all because you didn\\'t do as well as you should have ingame? Well I\\'ve got some good news for you! Warframe\\'s community is nothing short of AMAZING. If you ask a question about ANYTHING in the Region Chat, you are guaranteed to get a helpful response back from multiple people. There\\'s even an entirely separate chat called the Recruit Chat in which you can literally ask for help if you\\'re having difficulty accomplishing something. Ontop of that, Digital Extremes themselves regularly have Livestreams where they interact with the fanbase of the game itself; in which they give out Free 1000 Platinum OR a Legendary Fusion Core to people regularly when these livestreams occur every couple of weeks.\\nNow what of the Gameplay? Well, the best way to describe this game quickly is with one 3 word sentence:\\nDESTINY DONE RIGHT.\\nThis game has a similar concept to how Destiny\\'s gameplay was setting itself up to be, but it literally fixes EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM that Destiny has within the 1st 10-15 minutes of playing the game for your first time. You will NEVER EVER hear the words \"There\\'s no time to explain why I have no time to explain\" out of ANYONE\\'S MOUTH in this entire game. The storytelling of this game, while still a WIP as of this review, has only gotten Better and Better. Especially after the release of Update 18, which completely changed the way everyone percieved Warframes and the Tenno forever. The Second Dream quest that came with that update didn\\'t even feel like a quest. After you finish it, it feels like you just walked out of threater after watching A GREAT MOVIE. The Lore of Warframe has only gotten better and better as the updates came through, and I can\\'t wait to see more now that Digital Extremes got themselves a brand new Motion Capture Studio for themselves to make Animated CG Cutscenes.\\nCombat is divided into both PvP and PvE, but the main focus of the game is primarily on the PvE side of things, with PvP being an Optional Game Mode that has completely different rules and regulations from the PvE part of the game entirely. The gameplay itself is a mix of a variety of different gameplay types in one. Hardcore Parkour + MOBA + Third Person Shooter + Hack & Slash + Stealth ALL IN ONE GAME. That\\'s Warframe\\'s Gameplay in a nutshell. It lets you choose how you wanna play your game. Do you wanna go Balls-Out Guns-A-Blazing? Go for it! Do you wanna go in all Sneaky-Like and go Stealth? Go right ahead! As for the MOBA part, that\\'s where the Warframes themselves come into play to describe that one. Each Warframe has 3 Special Abilities and 1 Ultimate Ability; and sometimes even a Passive Ability as well, depending on the Warframe. This formula has been used constantly amongst MOBAs like League of Legends and DotA 2, and it\\'s also used here as well. And with this game, it works perfectly. Each Warframe plays different from one another, and no Warframe feels the same as the other does. Granted, certain Warframes need to be updated and reworked; as of this Review. But Digital Extremes will definitely get around to it. Some Warframes that are in desperate need of a rework at this time are Warframes such as Mag, Volt, Oberon, and Nekros; as examples. But again, DE will get around to them eventually. Mag and Volt are already confirmed to be getting reworked even as I type this review out right now. As for the Warframe Combat itself, that\\'s where things get fun. All the Guns and Melee Weapons in the game are fully customizable with an In-Depth Mod System to add stats and buffs to your weapons exactly the way you see fit for your style of play. The game allows you to have 3 Mod Loadouts, listed as \"Config A\", \"Config B\", and \"Config C\". And you can switch them on the fly right before each mission so you know exactly which loadout to go with for each enemy faction in the game.\\nNow what about Character Customization? Lemme tell you, this game went ♥♥♥♥ing ALL OUT with that one. If there\\'s was a word to describe Warframe, it would be \"Pay 2 Bling\". The majority of the♥♥♥♥♥♥you buy with Platinum and Steam Wallet Funds are all purely Aesthetics. And there is a HELL OF A LOT to choose from. Dozens of Color Pallets, Syandana Scarfs, Armor Platings, etc.... You can make your Warframe as badass-looking as you want it to be.\\nAnd of course, Archwing. How could I forget about Archwing? Now to be fair, this is one of the more \"Heavy WIP\" Gamemodes that Warframe has, but even right now, it\\'s still FUN AS HELL to play. Flying through space with a Winged Jetpack strapped on your♥♥♥♥♥at Mach 1 Speeds is fast-paced and feels like you\\'re playing Zone of the Enders in a way. But as I said before, this type of gameplay is Heavy WIP, and there still is a lot more to be done wiith it to polish it up. Mobile Defense and Defense Missions need to be completely reworked, and Environments need to be a bit more varied. Ontop of that, the enemies are a bit bugged right now AND the Variety of Archwings and Weapons needs serious work. Right now, the Itzal Archwing is overpowered so badly to the point where it outclasses literally every other Archwing in the game by a large margin. But I\\'m sure DE will fix it eventually.\\nThe bottom line here is this:\\nThis game is absolutely amazing for so many reasons. It is a milestone with the Free 2 Play MMO Market, and should be set highly as an example of how to do a Free 2 Play System done right. And the gameplay is absolutely fantastic. When they said \"Ninjas Play Free\", Digital Extremes was NOT KIDDING. This game is the True Definition of what Free 2 Play should be like for Every Free MMO out there.\\nWtf are you still reading this for?! Go and play this game! Do it!',\n",

This allows for multiple combinations of mods to get different desired advantages, to fight certain factions or missions.  \\nThe forma is also a great way to make a weapon use less points in certain slots allowing you to develop it even further. \\nThe setting is great and in my opinion helped attract alot of people to this game. The atmosphere and level designs are becoming more varied as the developers are updating the game with new environments. The new environments are really fun to play in and sometimes have their own perks. \\nAs someone who made a long guide for this game I can say that their updates are so solid I feel my guide gets outdated every month and requires me to go back and make it relevant. This is most apparent in their UI changes they have made which made my videos a-bit weird to see for the newer players. \\nThe dojo is one of the nicest additions I have seen yet. Not only does it offer a nice place for members to go to but in a sense its structure is an achievement of everyone who has helped contribute to it. The dojo offers a wide variety of nice side things like being able to do pvp, and being able to craft new weapons that are only available through research. \\nIf you are worried about this game being pay to win rest assured that’s not how it is. The only real benefit to paying besides cosmetics is being able to get slots. You can put time in and get the same results you just can't have many Warframes/Weapons at once. They also designed it in a way that is hybrid in some areas. For example in foundry you will be able to pay money to speed up the process. So instead of buying the weapon, you can collect the resources, craft the item in foundry and then pay to speed up the process so you don't have to wait. \\nYes, there is grinding when you are looking for specific warframes and materials. Generally you will grind in the places where you reap the most benefits and try to get the pay-off aka the warframe as soon as possible. The grinding got a bit worse in a way when they introduced more materials which made the chances lower of getting blueprints. This is setoff a bit by the fact that they introduced alot more environment maps which increase its replayability. So if you do not mind grinding, buy slots to make more warframes if you like the game enough.\\nOverall Warframe is a classic example of how free to play games can be great and interesting and still give developers plenty of profits without turning it into a Pay to Win game. If you are looking for an interesting game.... just give it a try, I am sure it won't disappoint.\",\n",

       " '*This review has been edited on 25/12/2016*\\nYou\\'d think 2K hours, probably spending almost that much money in this game (Maybe more.) and being one of the founders of the game would mean that I love it to death?\\nI did until the Devs changed a bunch of stuff, and started showing signs of bias and corruption within the community.\\nGood game at its core, albeit pay-to-skip. Has a decent, high octane combat system. It\\'s a great power fantasy game, extremely fun. Gets a bit boring and grindy because you have to farm materials and pieces of gear based on RNG.\\nI personally don\\'t feel like the Devs listen or care much. They\\'ve made many changes I\\'m not a fan of (In fact, I know a few people who hate the changes more than I do.), and if I ever go back to the game? I refuse to spend another cent on it.\\nAlso, the community drama scene on Youtube with a certain Youtuber who I can\\'t name because Digital Extremes often ban people just for even mentioning his name, being associated with him, or whatever.  Just shows how corrupt the developers are since they banned him for doing stuff that their Youtube partners do all of the time, yet they don\\'t get banned. One of them even said on Stream that his fans and the other Warframe YT partners should send a hate mob to this unnamed YT\\'rs channel. Of course, after he got called out on this (Probably got a finger wagging from Digital Extremes), he tried to take down all evidence of the stream. Classy.\\nOh, and new content becomes increasingly more difficult to get, as well as suffers from power creepage.\\nAn example: A lot of the new Warframes and weapons require this stuff called Nitain extract. You often need a lot of this stuff just to build this new content, but you can only get it when a mission has been modified into a special kind of mission (Kind of like how it works with the new Relic system) called \"Alert Missions\" which only pop up for a few minutes or hours, depending. \\nWhilst I used to just buy the new stuff since I hate farming, my friends would often complain about how irritating it is to get Nitain simply because the alerts randomly decide when you\\'re allowed to obtain it. You would often need a lot of it too, from my limited understanding, and that\\'s just ♥♥♥♥♥♥. \\nThe game also lacks endgame content. Once you have everything, there\\'s just nothing to do other than help friends grind for the stuff that you got before them or w/e. This game will get boring very fast for you if you\\'ve sunk a lot of time and/or money into it.\\n*EDIT*\\nI should mention the new prime part system, in my opinion? Sucks.\\nIt used to be that you would do a level that needed an easy to get key, getting the key and finishing the levels wasn\\'t hard nor did it ever take long. When you finished the level, you would randomly get either a prime part, blueprints, or rare materials based on RNG rolls.\\nNow? You have to get these stupid relic keys, wait for an alert (kind of like Nitain) that has the class/level of relic that you need for the part that is in the specific drop table that the relic has. THEN you have to not only complete the standard level in its entirety, but you also have to do an annoying and needlessly finnicky minigame where you kill waves of enemies until you grab enough orb things to unlock the relic.  Needless change. \\nThe only good thing about the changes in this is that everyone usually gets different parts, and if a squadmate gets something you wanted, but you got something nobody in your squad wanted, you can pick what your squadmate got for free, and he/she would still get their own copy.\\n*END OF EDIT*\\nI don\\'t mind if you love this game, or hate my review. I\\'m probably gonna regret writing this. But, meh. \\nThis isn\\'t really me trying to say \"Don\\'t play this game\", more so explaining why I\\'ve quit.\\nAnd if it does influence you into not playing this game, or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me for my opinions, then so be it.',\n",
       " 'With nearly a quarter of a million reviews at the time of posting, it\\'s hard to say anything about Warframe that hasn\\'t already been said. Warframe is frightfully addictive, and once you get over the initial wall of \"What the hell is going on\", it can be very hard to put it back down. So many of the negative reviews on Steam consist of \"The game has changed\" or \"It ruined my life\" and, when you\\'ve sunk so many hundreds of hours into a game, I find it somewhat insulting that some people still choose to leave negative reviews on a free game. That\\'s not to say Warframe is faultless, but after earning hundreds of hours of your time, it feels like you must\\'ve enjoyed the game at some point.\\nWarframe is a third person hacky/slashy shooter set in space with robot-like ninjas. That sentence is about as awesome as playing the game, and the combat is incredibly satisfyting once you get the hang of it (and a few decent weapons). Many of the characters feel unique, albeit with some redundant characters (frames) cluttering up what could be (and still is mostly) an impressively diverse roster (The same applies to weaponry too). \\nMissions go through small instances in teams of 1-4 to complete certain objectives, whether it be rescuing a target, eliminating hostiles or defending a point. All missions are \"somewhat\" procedurally generated bar the story missions. By \"Somewhat\", I mean \"You\\'ll start to recognise each room a ton, but they can pop up in any order and multiple times\". I can practically recall every room you can find on \"Pluto Excavation: Hierarchon\", since that particular mission has taken more hours from me than some entire games have.\\nBut I digress, Warframe is enjoyable... on three conditions:\\n- Excercise some self-control - Those without willpower may find themselves completely sucked into the world of Warframe. Wallets may empty and lives may crumble. It harkens back to the days of Everquest and the whole \"Whoops, I was mid-raid and forgot to feed my baby.\" So... self-control guys.\\n- Set your own goals - Those who need a game to tell them exactly what to do will struggle with Warframe. Besides a few story missions that will take a few hours, getting strong enough to take them on will require hours of working on building your arsenal through modding your frames and weapons or acquiring new ones. This takes time and, without a sense of direction, I can see players simply going through missions one by one and getting frustrated by difficulty or repetition quickly. Chill out, pick a gun, bow, sword or whatever, and just work towards it. It\\'s a slow but rewarding process.\\n- Bring or find some friends - Warframe can be a lonely place, even in groups, if you have no-one to talk to in a one hour defence mission. Having some people to laugh with, work with and rage with against GOD DAMN LECH KRIL WHY IS HIS HIT BOX FOR HIS THING SO TINY AAAAH will help immensely.\\nThis game is full of potential. A way to earn the supposedly \"P2W\" currency through trading, Bosses, Raids, Pets, Secret powers, this game has it all. As long as you love doing sweet flips off walls, shooting guys in mid-air and can keep yourself from going mad, this game is potentially timesink gold for anyone looking for a new game to keep themselves occupied.\\nWarframe is great. It\\'s eaten more hours than any game I\\'ve ever played on Steam and I can forsee it taking more as they continue to update this already vast game. It\\'s worth your time to at least give it a few hours. It\\'s free, after all, so why not?',\n",
       " 'Oh boy.\\nWarframe\\'s not a typical MMO. It\\'s a squad based third person shooter set in the FAR future. You, the player, are of the Tenno faction, commanding Warframes under the guideance of the Lotus. Aka: Space Mom. The other factions of the game, which can be your ally one moment, foe the next, are the cloned disasters Grineer, with their levels and design of armor and weapons designed around metal and machinery. Their goal is to one day find a cure for their species, which rapidly degrade due to the cloning process. The Corpus, their rival faction, is all about tech and greed. They\\'re smart. Sly. Always send robots to do their jobs. Credits (the in game currency) are their first and last prize, hardly joining in commadery. Dominating the market, even joining all sides of a war to make trade while at war with them is their buisness. The Orokin, The Infested, and The Sentients...well, they\\'re secretive, bizzare, and supposedly long gone.\\nUnlike a lot of F2P MMOs, their \"premium currency\" can be obtained through trading with other players. While the game can\\'t be considered \"pay 2 win\" due to the extreme focus on Co-Op gameplay, it\\'s diminished a little due to the existance of the Conclave, the PVP enviorment. It\\'s completely reasonable to ignore this mode as, well, there\\'s no forced reason apon one to play it. I for one tried a few rounds, and that\\'s all. It\\'s community is the complete opposite of Warframe\\'s normal side. It\\'s incredibly toxic, even in the team based PVP.\\nThe normal parts of the game can get really chaotic. Your main goal in the game, really, can be many things. From hoarding every piece of equipment, right down to scanning everything in a massive lorehunt. Players are technically overpowered, and will pretty much always be this way. You\\'re a metal ninja with stuff straight out of magic, defying the laws of gravity, even create Limbo in a area!\\nThe combat\\'s pretty fun. If you\\'re a fan of being moble, you\\'re going to love this game. Even if you play Rhino, the typical tank \"Frame\" (playable character) can still run on walls, hop up walls, hang onto them, superjump, even have mid-air bullettime! Later levels and planets in the game can get absolutely insane with the number of mobs from the many factions. Nothing ever feels as good as firing two rounds of a shotgun with radiated fire bullets and have it\\'s ultimate skill send off a AOE that melts away armor and just makes everything explode. Loot flying everywhere!\\nThere\\'s a problem with the loot, though, that can push people away. It\\'s timed. Weapons can take from several hours to a full day to craft. On top of this, you need to farm for materials to craft them to begin with. Platnium can come in to speed up the process, so it has the feeling of the typical, bad facebook game. ESPECIALLY when it comes to the THREE day wait on new frames once you\\'ve finished the parts. If anything, you should save platnium for these times.\\nThankfully, this game doesn\\'t force any kind of \"Membership\" status down your throat. There\\'s no levels in the game locked off with money. Only in your skill and equipment, clearing level after level to unlock the planets you need.\\nThe enviorments, I feel, have the most love out of anything else in the game. Lush forests overtaking machinery, outer space filled with astroid and ship debree, underwater combat, infected ships and planets...Deserts, snowy reigons..There\\'s a lot to see, here.\\nThe game also doesn\\'t take too much to actually play. I can\\'t play Fallout 4, I can just barely play Injustice, but I can easilly run this game on around medium settings.\\nBeware, the game IS a grind. If you have time, you will be having that time spent farming and fighting. RNG can bless you, or hate you as you try to grind for the same item for weeks.\\nIf you\\'re still interested in Warframe, go for it! It IS free! I reccomend it overall!',\n",

The levels look great and get better each time the dev’s take a look at them usually adding new effects and rooms to fight in. The enemies you fight (while kinda stale) all look good and can be cut into pieces, burnt to ashes, melted, electrocuted, smashed into the distance or frozen which while not anything groundbreaking, does lead to some memorable moments.\\n•\\tWarframe’s combat is fast paced and varied in what you can use to fight your way through hordes of soldiers, robots, or space zombies. Jumping ahead at what feels like 60 mph to swing a great sword at the head of some poor sob never really seemed to lose its appeal.\\n•\\tWarframes payment scheme is mostly pretty forgiving, you can earn things in-game by working for them, if you want them quicker there’s always the option of tossing some money at the screen.\\nUnfortunately these two areas are all that really shined for me, some things to think about before you jump into the game.\\n•\\tWarframe hardly ever tries to explain itself to new players. A game where the wiki is more helpful than the tutorial. Fortunately the community loves to take newer players under their wings. However when new mechanics are introduced the players are on their own to figure it out or get help from other players who simply took the punches.\\n•\\tWarframe is a grind that can wear down players pretty quickly depending on what their goals are. If you happen to like the wrong weapon you may be in for some punishment while you pray to the RNG gods for the right key to get that last piece with a drop rate of 0.12%. Looking at recent additions, attitudes and past experience points towards this grind only getting worse in the future.\\n•\\tThe Dev’s for warframe (D.E.) are very fickle to put it politely. They’ll add something great only to muddy it up with ill thought out details or what feels like a rushed job. A recent example would be a new gun, the Hema, which is costing years’ worth of resources to build in an attempt to drain the player’s stock piles or force them to pump currency into the game to bypass this. \\nOn one hand stockpiles need to be drained so your players don’t chew through new content too quickly. On the other hand there are better ways of doing this than with a swift kick to the teeth. D.E. will leave the gun as is until sales drop, and then they’ll adjust the costs to avoid the community’s ire. This has happened numerous times and for some including me, these practices intentional or not are a turn off. \\nIf not for their excellent community manager Rebecca this game would not be where it is today with the way DE does things.\\n•\\tIf you’re a solo player you will put out more effort and time for less pay off than a group of four players who do less yet gain more, many times an event has happened and it’s been impossible for solo players to even attempt due to bad design (which is thankfully hotfixed in a day or two).  Warframe is made as a co-op game; it only allows you to solo as an option so keep this in mind if you have a bad internet connection.\\n•\\tWarframe is FILLED with forgotten mechanics and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ideas that were all left to rot. Heres a list within a list of some of these.\\n1.\\tClans\\n2.\\tArchwing\\n3.\\tCodex/Scanning\\n4.\\tSyndicates\\n5.\\tRelays\\n6.\\tThe focus system\\n7.\\tChanneling\\n8.\\tInvasions\\n9.\\tSolor Rails and solor rail conflicts\\n10.\\tOperators\\n11.\\tRaids\\n12.\\tRivens\\n13.\\tRathuum\\n14.\\tSoon to be: the infested room\\n•\\tWarframe has little to no balance to it.

       " 'So after playing Warframe for 1,040 hours (Steam says about 658 hours, but it\\'s incorrect.), I finally decided to write a review on the game. In this review, I\\'ll be stating how \"Free to Play\" the game actually is and what the gameplay is like, what the game offers in terms of content, and a pros/cons list at the end of the review to sum things up.\\n       \\nSo first off, how Free to Play is this game anyways? As a lot of us know, most Free to Play games have you paying for microtransactions to get most content in the game, with no way of using the in-game resources or currency to get them instead. Warframe does not do this, only cosmetic items, color pallets, interior decorations for your Liset, etc. Things like Weapons, Warframes, and Companions can all be earned by playing the game and getting enough resources/credits. Although Warframe and Weapons slots can\\'t be obtained without platinum (Warframe slots are 20 platinum each and weapon slots are 2 for 12 platinum), you can trade items in the trade channel to people in exchange for platinum. Another thing I should mention is Foundry build rushing. If you are building a weapon or Warframe in the foundry, you will notice a \"Rush build\" option. This isn\\'t spendy though, usually only costing 25-50 platinum to do so. Trust me, if you have what people want, you can obtain a hefty amount of platinum without paying a dime and have plenty to spend on rushing builds or buying slots.\\n       \\nNow if you actually start liking the game and want to spend money to get things quicker, this is where you could have a tough time. Market prices from Digital Extremes are, you could say, \"Extreme\". With Weapons usually costing about $5-$12 depending on the weapons and Warframes costing $5-$20 depending on the Warframe. To put this into a better perspective, it costs $5 for the most basic package of platinum, which is 75 platinum, all the way to $200 worth of platinum, which is 4300 platinum. There is a cheaper way to get platinum though. The game has a login reward system and sometimes you can get a coupon for 25%, 50%, and 75% off your next platinum purchase. This would be an ideal time to buy some. They started doing Prime Access, which allows you to access the lastest prime Warframe and weapons instantly.....for $150 of course. The cheapest package you can get in Prime Access give you just the prime accessories, a 90 day Affinity Booster, and a 90 day Credit Booster....for $50!! I feel Prime Access just isnt all that affordable, but maybe that\\'s just me. My rating on Warframe\\'s Free to Play factor is a 9/10.\\n         \\nAlright, next thing to talk about is the actual gameplay. Is it fun? Is it rewarding? Well, Warframe can be very fun to play at times, other times it can be annoying and tedious to play. It\\'s a 3rd person view Co-Op/PvP shooter with unique elements that will be talked about later. In the beginning, you will have a choice among 3 Warframes ( Excalibur, Mag, or Volt), you will have a choice between 2 primary weapons ( MK1-Braton or MK1-Paris), you will have a choice between 2 secondary weapons (Lato or MK1-Kunai), and you will have a choice between 2 melee weapons (Skana or MK1-Bo). Either of the Warframe are fun to play, in my opinion. The MK1-Braton is garbage, both secondaries are good for beginners, and both melee weapons are good for beginners as well. Getting used to some of the controls might be a pain at first (Such as wall-running and sliding), but eventualy you\\'ll get the hang of it and be flipping around like a space ninja in no time! Basically what I\\'m saying here is that the beginning of the game is hard to get past, in the sense that you feel underpowered and weak compared to your foes. If stick with it long enough to get better equipment, then it becomes much more fun to play. Weapons are fun and all, but I think the Warframes are what spice the game up the most. Each Warframe has a set of 4 powers that you unlock as you rank them up. The powers are some of the most fun this game has to offer. Example scenario: You are a rank 10 Excalibur surrounded by 25 Grineer troopers and there are just too many to shoot and kill before you die yourself. What do you do at this point? Activate Radial Javelin, which is your most powerful power as Excalibur, and watch as all 25 of them are pinned to the walls around you. Eventually, you\\'ll be able to do the same thing, but with 50 guys surrounding you. Warframe powers, yes please. Now what about rewarding gameplay? This game can reward you at times, however, it can be very grindy. The first thing you\\'ll probably farm for in this game are resources. Resources aren\\'t that painful to try to get, although Orokin Cells, Neurodes, Neural Sensors, and Argon Crystals are the ones you will be grinding out on the most. In terms of farming, the only real things that could be tedious to obtain are Warframe parts and Archwing parts. Speaking of Archwing, if you have played the game awhile now and feel the need for something new to do, try getting the Odonata Archwing and fly through deep space in Archwing missions. It\\'s a breath of fresh air if you feel like ground combat is getting boring. Gameplay can get pretty intense at times, if you finally have the loadout to survive 30 minutes on Warframe\\'s survival gamemode or 30+ waves on Warframe\\'s defense mode. All in all, the gameplay is fun, the farming/grinding isn\\'t always fun, but once you get that weapon built or Warframe built, the fun begins yet again. Overall, Warframe\\'s gameplay gets an 8/10 from me.\\n         \\nNow to talk about what Warframe has to offer in terms of content. Well, it has a lot of content to offer compared to when I started back in June 2013. There are 22 Warframes available to play as, not counting the Prime Warframes (Only difference is they have an extra polarity and look way cooler). There are  100+ weapons in the game as well, not to mention the primes of course. There are 14 planets to visit, each with increasing number of missions available. Tons of mods to choose from, including melee stances, which enhance your melee weapons by allowing you to perform combos. Just, plenty of content for a newcomer to explore.  Usually every two months, Digitial Extremes puts out a massive update, usually going up a whole number ( As in Update 14.5 goes to Update 15). These massive updates add hours upon hours of new things to do. Warframe\\'s  amount of content gets a 10/10 from me.\\nPros:\\n-The game is fun to play once you get the hang of things.\\n-Easy to learn thanks to a tutorial\\n-PvE and PvP\\n-You can earn content in the game without paying\\n-Friendly community\\n-There is a wealth of content\\n-At least 7 gamemodes to play\\n-Endgame is cool, more to come!\\n-No Pay to Win business models\\n-Rewarding exploration (Especially in Void missions)\\n-Warframe powers are fun as hell\\n-Boss fights are awesome for a F2P\\n-Alerts, Invasions, and Infestations as daily missions are great and rewarding\\n-Most weapons past the beginner ones are fun to use\\n-Pet dogs\\nCons:\\n-Market pricing is a bit steep\\n-Prime access is ridiculous\\n-There is some farming/grinding\\n-Some bugs still in the game a frustrating\\n-Napalms are jerks\\n-Beginning of the game loadouts can be tough to get past (Because of how underpowered they feel)\\n-Higher mastery rank Tenno entering your game could ruin the experience for you\\n-Some people in trade overprice everything ever\\nLet me know if there\\'s anything I could add, as this is my first review :).\\nThanks for reading, Tenno.\\nEdit 1: All cosmetics except for TennoGen stuff can be aquired without paying for platinum. Just use trade chat to get platinum!\\nEdit 2: Digital Extremes has moved to a less predictable update pattern that usually results in the updates being packed with new content and now cinematic quests!\\nEdit 3: Prime parts are less tedious to obtain thanks to the Void Relic system added recently!',\n",
       " '\"Ninjas play free and slay gleefully\"\\nWarframe is the pet project of Digital Extreme, the canadian development team that has been behind the Unreal series, Bioshock and The Darkness 2 (along with Homefront which was still a good game overall despite its many flaws). A cooperative third person shooter with impressive visuals and art style, refined parkour and mobility options as well as an interesting take on sci-fi, it is one of the most active, successful and evolving game on the F2P market.\\nSet in the far future of the darkSector universe, the solar system is now in a constant war between the conquering Grineer and the merchant guilds of the Corpus while also brushing off the Infested, remnants of a bio-weapon from the past. In this age of conflict, An order of warriors who were thought to have disappeared come back at the request of an entity known only as the Lotus. The Tenno are awakened from their slumber anew, their powers only matched by their mastery of the Warframes\\nBeing a free to play title, this question will always come at the forefront of people\\'s mind. Put simply, let\\'s take in consideration what \"Pay to Win\" entails : the term signifies that a game allows paying customers to \\n than non-paying customers with no option for the non-paying customers to match this power equitably.\\nWarframe does not, in fact, allow paying customers to gain such power. In fact, most of the exclusively paying content of Warframe lies in cosmetics alternatives like skins, color sets, accessories and such. While you \\'can\\' purchase some weapons, Warframe and such with platinum (the paid currency in the game), these are also obtainable through seeking out the equipment\\'s blueprints and parts then crafting them into the desired items.\\nEven more so, many of the Prime equipment (more embellished version of the regular gear) cannot be bought outright except outside of a Prime Access offer which allows paying customers to gain a set of gear corresponding to the most recent Prime Warframe released. Even so, the difference lies that those who purchase a Prime Access do get a few cosmetics atop of the already obtainable Warframe and weapons through regular play.\\nMoreover, the Platinum currency is often used in ingame trading between players as the mean to buy Prime equipment part blueprints and other such tradeable ressources. Thus, the Warframe economy works on a supply and demand system where gaining rare parts and mods (more about this later) can be then be exchanged to other players in order to gain Platinum without personally spending money.\\nFirstly, Warframe is a constantly evolving game that has been nearly three years running. The game that it was in closed beta (where I got the first chance to play) has changed so very much that many that returns to the game today find it an almost completely different experience. From the game being now more approachable to having added many features that the community suggested to even revamping entire systems already in place for others that expand the gameplay greatly :\\nAs a free to play game, there is the required incentive for players to pay for things they could get for free by playing, aka a \"time wall\". For one, crafting of most weapons and Warframes isn\\'t instantaneous and usually can be counted in hours and, in case of an entire Warframe build, days (aka 12 hours per part, which can be done simultaneously, then a 3 day build for the final combination of the parts into a Warframe). Along these are some of the few points that might vary depending on the player\\'s opinion on them :\\nWarframe will appeal to those who wish to play a shooter with satisfying firearm and melee combat mechanics, flashy powers that are varied and unique to every Warframe. While the loot drops and slight grindiness can be a turn off, it is often offset by just how the gameplay feels fluid and intuitive to get into.',\n",

       " \"This game is all sorts of amazing. I have played this game since around 4 years ago, taking 6 month breaks due to irl stuff and just being burnt out cause of how often i played this. \\nPros: \\nCompletely FTP - you can get pretty much everything in this game (besides some community made stuff - which are cosmetics only) just by playing the game. There is a currency you can get called plat which you can pay money for, but you can also get it just by trading people in the community prime pieces of equipment. You can get any weapon, frame, gear, pet, cosmetic just by playing the game.\\nTons of fun - I have over 1k hours in the game and i STILL am having a lot of fun with the movement system, all the different guns, all the different missions etc.\\nCommunity is amazing - For the most part the community is extremely helpful. I say for the most part because there are always trolls in free to play games, but i would say a good 60% (at least) of the people in this game have a relatively decent understanding of the game and know what they are doing and will try to help you out.\\nConsistent updates - Warframe comes out with a huge update, meaning new content, about once every 2 months or so. as well as a bunch of hotfixes (bugfixes) in between those times to try and fix the stuff they tend to mess up.\\nThe developers - The dev team behind this game is probably the most interactive dev team i have ever seen in any game i have played. they constantly are playing with the community, talking to them, and getting ideas from them. They occasionally upset the community with some things they do but if that happends, they tend to try and right what they did which i love. This game is completely community based and its beautiful to see it.\\nThe quests - This game's storytelling has gotten SO much better as time went on. all the new quests they have put out the past couple years have just gotten deeper and deeper with richer and richer storytelling. although some of them are fairly short the stories they tell are absolutely amazing.\\nCons:\\nVery rough on new players - Now grant it, this game has gotten a LOT better at helping new players adapt to the game, but there is much to be done. If you are a completely new player this game doesnt do a whole lot to help you. Now, on the same side of this the community which has played this for a long time (including me) understands this and tries to help out the newer players to try and help people. So if you arent used to fast paced gameplay, i would advise you to try and find some people to play this with to try and make it easier on yourself.\\nVery buggy - Even with all the hotfixes and stuff there are a LOT of bugs in this game. There is even a nickname for this game which is Bugframe. Sounds bad right? its not a huge con though, a lot of the bugs are pretty funny when they happen, very rarely are their any game breaking bugs that make it unplayable. It is mainly slight annoyances that with time will be fixed. \\nSummary:\\nThis game is absolutely AMAZING, it's progress has been amazing so far. It has gone from being a very bland space ninja, to an extravagant ever-growing beautiful space ninja. i can say without a doubt, if you are looking into this game you should definetly try it out. Everything the devs have done so far is absoutely amazing and it will continue on as time goes. \\nRating:\\nI would honestly rate this game a 9.9/10 - the reason for the missing .1 is because it is pretty rough on the newer players,  when that is fixed it will be a 10/10. DEFINETLY worth picking up.\",\n",

       " 'If you asked me before Scorched Earth was announced I would well you that ARK was the best game ever made. For until you got to mid-late game, on singleplayer or with a small group of friends.\\nWith this type of game attracts griefers, minecraft has em, Rust has em. I don\\'t like dealing with them so I don\\'t play on public servers, and I had fun. The game was in early alpha so the bugs were acceptable.... for the most part.\\nThis game has everything you\\'d want in a dino survival game, taming, breeding, hunting, PVP and PVE elements. But one thing they don\\'t tell you is how taxing it is to maintain any of it as farther along you go. In Singleplay I never had to worry about starvation or building decay as they only needed food when the \\'server\\' was up. On official servers you have to log on almost daily to make sure your dinos have enough food to last the next 24 hours, Plus there\\'s spoilage (Rather forgiving honestly) you have to worry about, that feeding trough you filled to the brim with meat? it\\'s full of almost useless rotten meat (you can make narcotic to tame even more dinosaurs!) in just one day. the feeding trough has a x2 preserving rate (meaning everything lasts twice as long) whereas the fridge makes them last x4 times longer, but you can\\'t use a fridge to feed your animals.\\nFarming is okay, keep a large plot full of poop (Thank you Phomia\\'s) and you\\'ll be rewarded with better taming goodies, or even dyes (Paints irl are made from flowers and fruits), or better yet concoctions that help you with one aspect or another. But you need the actual recipe to know how to make them. I\\'d give farming a pass as it (like everything else) is based on real time.\\nYou want to be like Jurassic Park and breed your dinos? do you like having no time to do literally anything else (this includes going to the bathroom and getting a snack) Babies go through food fast (understandable, they need enough to grow) but can die really quickly without supervision, and by quickly I mean you have seconds to feed your newborn hatchling. Here\\'s the kicker: Until they hit juvenile they can\\'t eat from the feeding trough, only hand fed. The Juvenile stage was added long after breeding became a mechanic, meaning you had to baby sit that trex you were hoping to raise until it\\'s an adult before you can get a break. the only saving grace is that they can eat from their inventories and as they grow they\\'re allowed to carry more and more until you can actually get a break in. If you leave them for a day they will die (like say, needing to sleep because it\\'s midnight and you are exhausted from caring for it all day)\\nArk had so much promise back then. And then Scorched earth was announced as the first DLC for ARK. my first thoughts were \\'isn\\'t ark an early access game?\\' and went to check, it was still an early access game at the time, it\\'s released now with all the bugs that should have been ironed out, more on that later. Developers seem to have misunderstood what \\'Early Access\\' means, Early Access means that the developer is allowing you (the player) to play thier unfinished game early. It\\'s a way of getting funding for the game as it\\'s being made rather than after it\\'s finished and then released. I wasn\\'t a fan of the Scorched Earth expansion, I never bought it no matter how cool it looked. but more for the message it told me: \"We\\'re more concerned about making money than finishing a game.\" Now I\\'m not ignorant to how games are made, I have a close freind who\\'s trying his hand at making games and on ocasion he\\'s told me the struggle. You need a pay check to give everyone, and ARK\\'s been in development for a long time so chances are they honestly needed the money to continue work on it. There are other ways to raise money that wouldn\\'t have made quite the ruckess, I\\'m not going to dwell on the past so I\\'ll leave it there.\\nAnd then Ragnarok became official \\'dlc\\', Wildcard has previously taken a fan made map and turned it into an official thing (The Center). But the problem is that this map has Scorched Earth accets on it, and it\\'s free. Meaning that I didn\\'t have to pay a dime extra to play with Scorched Earth content, the price tag for Scorched Earth now is just for the map. The glitch filled map.\\nI\\'ve never played on the Scorched Earth map, but they\\'re giving it the same care as they\\'ve given The Island. And ho boy are there issues with The Island. my Motto has always been to get a flier (usually an argy or peligornis) to safely get around, because if you took anything less than a Therizino you risked losing it to an Alpha. Alpha\\'s aide this motto has saved me a lot of stress as trying to navigate any terrain rougher than flat could lead to getting stuck, anything larger than a therizino can destroy trees, but nothing can save your rex if you get it lodged in free fall up against a cliff face. Or help you get back up to your dinos if you walk down a ramp only to find that you can\\'t walk right back up it. I\\'ve walked up a mountain on a Therizino (sheer face) simply because the mesh and hitbox weren\\'t the same, as some parts you actually dip into the mountain and can see beneath the map. This was there before Scorched Earth, I went to check again after release and it was still there.\\nI might not play multiplayer, but I keep tabs on the patch notes. The devs said that in the months leading up to the release they were going on a bug stomping spree instead of adding more content. There was only one patch and it added more dinos as well as getting rid of maybe one or two bugs.\\nWith a bit of reading aparently the clipping isn\\'t retrained to mountain climbing, you can have your dinos sniped from being outside of the map\\'s mesh. Speaking of mesh, if your rifle\\'s barrel is poking into the mountain (but your crosshair is clearly showing that you are aiming above the floor) you\\'ll shoot the mountain. This is a nitpick and most games have this issue, but newer players might want to know why they\\'re not hitting thier target even though it should be a headshot.\\nThese bugs are still here and now Wildcard\\'s announced the newest DLC to ARK, Abar-whatever. The problem is that they never stop adding content to optimize the game, ARK can lag hard at times (especially if it has to load lots of stuff) even when your graphics are on potatoe settings.\\nIf I didn\\'t know better I\\'d say that ARK was still in Early Access. if asked I\\'d tell you that I had fun with ARK. Nothings more fun than rampaging through the land on a Rex killer for the catharsis. I\\'m writting this because every so often I\\'ll check ARK\\'s news section and I see that Wildcard\\'s hinted at a sequel to ARK and I\\'ve never been more horrified. ARK is not a finished game, but it wears the skin of one.\\nGrinding resources to build anything isn\\'t fun, you mean to tell me that breaking this rock that\\'s five times my height only gives enough stone to make a flimsey wall? This game isn\\'t rewarding, the only fun is in the catharsis in sticking it to the mechanics that seek to keep you down. All of this is from a singleplayer perspective, but I\\'ve heard of what happens in the official servers:\\nAlpha tribes policing fun across every server. greifers able to vanish in the wind with the server transfer mechanic AFTER stealing all of your stuff. Tribes using the Server transfer mechanic to raid other servers when the tribes are offline for the day. This was offset by the fact that there were ways to block the obilisks and airdrops so that you couldn\\'t use the server transfer mechanic.\\nThe devs, as always. Instead of listening to the playerbase they rely on, made preventing this mechanic a banable offence instead of removing it. They\\'re allowing the greifers and the server wipers to go rampart. All of this combined is why I play singleplayer or with a few friends. In all honesty and love of this game, I cannot recommend it to ANYONE, but I will tell people about it and what it used to be.

Want to train a dino, well first go spend about an hour or more just collocting hundreds of berries if it a low level herbivore, and then sit around for about an hour well you wait to feed it more narcos.) If you ever do spend enough time in game to complete something substantial, you better beware, because basically everyone else on the island has spent just a little more time grinding then you and will kill you and destroy everything you own while your offline. The only way I have enjoyed playing this was with freinds, but you spend so much time finding each other, that normally one of you has to get off, and then you are all killed offline and have to start over again. There is very little skill in this game, 75% of the times i died in multi, was while I was offline, even the time where I had actually managed to build a multi walled structure with dinos protecting it. Maybe if the servers were more orginized into cities or vilages it would be funner, or if there was a better comunity. I am not asking for the game to be easier, I like hard games, I just don't have enough time to play a game were I have to grind for hours to achieve the slightest thing, then in the periods where I am actually dealing with real life, lose everything I spent my time on. The crafting system is also actremely generic, simplified to only a button click or 2. Unlocking new recipies is just a matter of grinding to level up.

To unlock the ability to complete a test you again have to play the game.\\nYour items, warframe, weapons, sentinels, etc, all have levels as they go up levels you gain more experience thus can eventualy do a test you unlock another mastery rank.\\nIn a way this game can be very grindy, but with each frame offering 5 differing powers and a differing look and considering you can choose whatever weapons you want it makes this game have alot of replay ability.\\nMy only gripe is a few things....the tutorial and help stuff isnt very good....at times i didnt see what i was supposed to do next and didnt see the small text explaining my powers or how i could open certain lockers etc.  In addition I literally had to look some things up on a warframe wiki or just found out after readiong some of the in game players chatting about differing things.\\nAlso many missions seam to just all together give up on stealth....there you are sneaking around taking your time....and suddenly everything comes after you.\\nI tend to do things slowly....i like to ninja the missions in games...kill them all so to speak at times.....but this game sometimes forces me to run out.  \\nFissure missions, bounty missions and infested missions all have this global they come right at you thing.....no matter where you are.....its very annoying.\\nThis in turn makes me miss items and hidden stuff....which is annoying and disapointing.\\nAll in all i recommend this game.\\nThey are continualy updating and fixing things....the newest frame called the titania is alot of fun to play.\\nAll i need now is a cat one(cat ears and a tail on a female frame) i can already think of what it would have on it.\\nSooo in conclusion....play this game....its free after all.',\n",

       " 'Warframe is a fast paced RPG, Hack and Slash, and Third Person Shooter mix that blend concepts from popular games like Halo, Assassins Creed, and Call of Duty into one jam packed free-to-play online game. This game supports nearly every play style, and there is no one way to play. Unlike other games with four or five classes, this game includes 20 unique armors with unique skills to aid in your fight and with new ones added frequently. Also unlike most other free-to-play games it is not pay-to-win. Granted, you can only go so far in the game without the ‘special’ currency which you have to use to get extra ‘slots’ to store your armor and weapons, but that’s is one of the best parts of this game, you don’t have to spend a penny to get this currency, you can trade it with other players for things you’ve obtained in your missions that they need, you know how some people want to just buy their way to the end of the game, so there are always people buying and selling things to each other passing around this currency to each other. As far as the graphics go I am extremely impressed. The graphics surpass those of a lot of games that cost $40+ and still remain free-to-play. The gameplay is even more impressive, with 20 different ‘warframes’ to choose from and each having unique abilities, the game is very dynamic. The way I might use my favorite warframe might not work for you and you might be killed frequently while I blaze through killing everyone. Also there is a miniature card game involved and each warframe and every weapon has ‘slots’ where the cards go drastically changing the stats, survivability, and the abilities of your warframe and weapons. These ‘mods’ are sometimes dropped by your fallen enemies with different enemies having different mods they can drop. These mods can also be traded with other players for the special currency, other mods, or for blueprints for special items found only in a special kind of mission. Which brings me to another aspect of the game: crafting. As you progress through the levels you will pick up materials that you use to build new weapons, armors, and some very useful equipment.  Different locations have different components that drop from them. Being a game that takes place in space, each of the different locations is an entire planet, although most of the time your missions are inside the ships orbiting these planets. Each planet has most of its ‘nodes’ ruled by a single one of the factions, from time to time there will be missions where you support one of the factions to either invade and take over the node or defend it from the opposing faction. There are three distinct factions: The Corpus, The Grineer, and the infestation. The Grineer are the first faction you come into contact with, they rule the entire first planet and are the faction in the tutorial. They are a race of humans deteriorated from years of excessive cloning. They are heavily armored units with standard bullet shooting guns and feature everything from standard machine  guns  to flamethrowers and rocket launchers. The next faction is The Corpus. These troops are a mix between robots with mounted laser guns and cyborgs with different laser shooting guns. These units also have recharging shields like those seen in Halo. This factions weaponry is comprised of mostly repeating energy guns, again much like those in Halo, and continuous beam lasers, also like those in Halo. Another Faction is the Infested. These are troops from the Grineer and Corpus that have been afflicted with a parasitic growth that takes over and changes their bodies, a lot of Halo references here, these being completely identical to the flood in how they work. These units are almost all melee units that are very strong and attack in swarms. As far as weapons go they have their claws and the heavier unit will slap you with its stretching arm. Almost every planet has their own boss which will randomly drop one of the three pieces you craft to form you new set of armor. Each boss has its own set of skills which most of the time will have some correlation to the warframe obtained from killing them. For example the boss General Sargus Ruk uses a flamethrower and has a variety of fire based abilities he uses to try and burn you alive. Upon his defeat he will drop one of the three parts needed to craft Ember, a fire based warframe with two abilities nearly identical to those of Ruk. While on the subject of bosses, I am going to mention another of my favorite features. Upon killing a boss you have a chance to receive a ‘death mark’. Getting one of these will give you a chance to have a deadly assassin, appropriately named The Stalker; spawn randomly into literally any mission many levels above you with extremely overpowered weapons. He is thought to be a rogue Tenno, those who can use the warframe armors, and has the same weapon load outs and many abilities shared with other warframe armors. As far as weapon load outs go, you may carry around a primary, secondary, and melee weapon, and have the choice of only bringing one weapon with you if you would like to. With this comes even more diversity in play styles. Personally I prefer t use mostly just a melee weapon, relying on a powerful long range primary and short range secondary for those tricky kills. Others might use only there primary weapon completely ignoring their secondary and melee weapons. Each weapon can be outfitted with mods to drastically change how the weapon works, one mod can cause your weapon to fire two bullets at  time, while another may cause your weapons bullets to travel through enemies and objects such as walls or doors. Right now there are nearly 350 of these mods with new ones added all the time. There is also a large variety of mission types. Some of these include defending a certain object from the enemy, destroying targets such as the ships power core, or special machinery, to straight up kill everything on the ship.  This game also includes a very popular RPG tool: customization. On top of the mods you add into your weapons/armor, you can also customize the clor of your weapons and armor, and there are special attachments, bought with that special currency or obtained through one of the frequent events. As a paid game I would give this a 9/10, but being completely free-to-play it gets a 10/10. Definitely a game worth trying, and if you don’t like it you can just delete it with no worry about money you waited because its free',\n",

       " 'Note - if you dislike the review, please feel free to leave why.\\nHaving put a good bit of time into it, I thought I\\'d finally \"review\" warframe. I\\'m not gonna do a stupid \"I jumped off a wall at a million miles an hour 9/10\" or \"Spun midair, became a rocket 11/10\" bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ Those aren\\'t reviews, and they aren\\'t useful.\\nSo, who am I? I\\'m a Hunter grade founder, roughly 1k hours (says 1.8k, WF in game says about 1k, I blame leaving it up while I sleep for the alerts :P), and I started playing in U7 so I\\'ve pretty much seen it all.\\nWF went from a game where they had cool ideas about what they wanted to do, to a bunch of half baked, never quite finished or polished ideas that eventually just seem abandoned. I.E. the revamp of damage/armour and weapons, Archwing, or Void Tower missions. Void missions were meant to be hard, and for the elite, and have amazing loot according to DESteve before they were implemented, but in reality they are very easy, and just another place to run a million missions hoping for the 1% drop chance for the item you want.\\nAs I see it now:\\nPros:\\n+Art team (sound, animation, graphics i.e.) is AMAZING (no sarcasm).\\n+Not P2W. Is it pay for convience, or pay to skip? Yes, to a fault imo, considering the prices are stupid. But everything can be earned in game, even if it takes a stupidly long time, and that time doesn\\'t corrospond to how good whatever the item you wanted is.\\n+Stamina/movement has been reworked. No longer do you run like a ninja. Who has asthma. And both their left lung just collapsed. And their right lung. And just had both their legs broken in a tragic zorencoptering incident.\\nCons:\\n-massive, MASSIVE grind and time walls (sometimes at the same time). Some grind is good, some waiting is ok. Done properly it enhances a game wonderfully, making that epic item so much sweeter and cool. WF however uses it in place of real content.\\n-P2P connection, no one likes lag, and WF rakes in cash. Servers should be a priority for WF.\\n-weapons are kinda meh. All the weapons of a given type feel the same (i.e. all bows feel the same, all snipers feel the same down to the RoF). By that, I mean they all just have slightly altered stats, none feel like they have recoil, or a worry about accuracy, or take more than point and click in the general direction. What I\\'m trying to say is that a lot of weapons (imo) just don\\'t FEEL like they should compared to a lot of other shooters.\\n-Plat is incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing expensive. I.e. weapon is around $10 roughly, and a new frame is roughly $20 iirc (assuming you don\\'t want to do the farming for them). To make it worse, there\\'s no rhyme or reason to their pricing. A garbage weapon might be more expensive than a better weapon for no reason, along with NO WAY to try before you buy ANYTHING. And contrary to what some people will say no, just because you like something does not automatically make it good, viable, or top tier.\\n-Enemies are stupid. The only difficulty there is for enemies is how many they throw at you, and how high their armor/HP/Shields and damage are. There\\'s no attempt here, not even say, to make the trash mobs stand by the heavy enemies who either give buffs, have bigger guns, and use special abilities (i.e. projecting a shield).\\n-Farming is either survival, interception, or defense missions. Everything else is either a ghost node (level/area) generally.\\n-Balance... doesn\\'t really exist outside of a general nebulous concept. This doesn\\'t sound like a problem, but balance is the lifeblood of any game. I\\'m not talking about one or two slightly OP weapons, I\\'m talking EVERYTHING is whacked. Clan tech weapons (very expensive to craft weapons) are mostly worse than what you can find in the markets for way cheaper (roughly 1/3 fewer mats in some cases). Worse, there are mods that have been around for a year roughly, and are just as useless as the day they were created, for example, \"Warm Coat\" is a mod that reduces shield reduction on missions that have the completely random ice effect, halving your shields. Besides the obvious flaw of not knowing when you\\'ll enter an ice mission, you\\'ll get better results from simply using a +shields mod of the same cost as Warm Coat.\\n-No endgame stuff. Sure there\\'s raids, but that\\'s just another place for them to add grind walls in place of real content. You\\'ll do some massive farming, but at the end of the day, it was all for naught unless you wanna run hour long survivals, or high wave interception/defenses. Once you get a weapon decently modded, any skill requirement goess out the window.\\n-Content is sparse, and often trapped behind massive grind or time walls to stretch it out. Problem with that is that it\\'s stretched nearly to the breaking point. Content comes down to grinding weapons/frames to level 30, forma\\'ing them (aka prestige) to make them slightly better, and repeat. Fusing mods to make them better and stronger, assuming you can FIND the ♥♥♥♥ing ones you want in the first place.\\n-New players have it extremely rough. They start off with garbage versions of mods, unknowingly, and the planets they unlock generally have the same mats, or atleast not enough different mats, which makes crafting anything very hard early on. Unless a new player has an older player helping them, they\\'re SOL. And the one thing that was supposed to help new players, the codex, doesn\\'t. You need to spend time unlocking it to learn enemy weaknesses, and what drops from them, making it even tougher for new players to learn about their enemies. Oh, and to scan the enemies? That costs credits for a consumable.\\n(INB4 \"But there\\'s a wiki!\" the info should be in game, easily accesible.)\\n-Lore, what they have is great, and really sets up a unique universe, the problem is that they don\\'t have almost ANY anywhere. Prime \\'frames in their codex entry have a tidbit, normally just an short few paragraphs, as do some of the other codex entries, and TSD which adds a good bit about the tenno. This isn\\'t so much of a con as they need more lore, which would be fantastic.\\n-Rushing\\nInherently nothing is wrong with rushing, but as a new player getting put with the more experienced players who just rush missions mean you\\'re getting left behind, and missing vauable loot (for a new player) as the mission ends early because people got to the extraction zone and started a 60 second timer to end the mission.\\n-Communication\\nThis is their biggest fault, their streams are a mess. DEsteve or DEScott usually being the cause. I feel sorry for DERebecca trying to control their lazy attitude towards the stream, treating it as a place to drink beer instead of answering question the community asks, and avoids/dodges questions with half answers or jackassery to (rarely) straight up insulting people (mild insults at best however) and flatout telling them they\\'re wrong despite everything saying they\\'re not (i.e. armor in D1.0 scalled up to a 95% reduction pretty quickly, and every weapon that did not ignore armor was pretty useless, DESteve was against reworking this, even though all but 4-5 weapons were considered useless).\\nAlso, going along with this, they\\'re NOTORIOUSLY poor at including all changes in the patch notes.\\n-Bugs! I expect some, hell, EVERYONE does. But DE either seems to do ZERO testing, or so little that people are unable to log onto the servers at all more than once. As in a 100% fail rate for everyone, not just a server overload or something. So, either they\\'re not doing enough in house testing, or they\\'re letting things get changed at the last moment before a patch rolls out.\\nConclusion:\\nI had high hopes for this game, and DE pretty much crushed them. If you like grinding korean MMO style, go for it. Otherwise stick with something better, like Evolve Stage 2 or, Overwatch. Or almost anything else.Overall, as the game is now, I cannot recommend it, as no matter how much things change, the more they stay the same.',\n",

       " 'Ok. I\\'ve put off writing a review for as long as possible in the vain hope that things would improve with this game. However, it is abundantly clear that the developers are - if anything - making a bigger and bigger mess of what started out as a great idea, that in spite of their lack of professional standards, customer support and communication skills,  Wildcards business unit (if they have one) have failed to force the \"creative\" side of Wildcard to take their fingers off the trigger and listen to some common sense and that - above all else - Wildcard really doesn\\'t listen to their customers, despite some virtue signalling from the companys appointed bubble-headed, blue haired moron to create an illusion to the contrary.\\n\"Early access\" be damned: these are people taking not insignificant amounts of money in PAYMENT for a product (AND for additional content!) that should - by definition of \"early access\" - be IMPROVING as time goes by, but it simply is not. The company has exposed its developers for the shoddy simpletons they really are. \\nThe only possible conclusion is that Wildcard are a somewhat fly by night group of amateurs, determined to \"take the money and run\", with little or no intention of sticking it out for the long haul.\\nAs an I.T. professional of 20+ years (most of which spent as a lead architect) and a small unofficial server owner with ~20-25 active players, I can honestly say that it is rare for me to experience first hand, a group of individuals profiting so much for such sub-par work. In any other industry, they would be fired; it is that simple. \\nOpinions are like a-holes: everyone has one, very few are worth listening to ;)\\nHowever the facts are incontrovertible:\\n1) Complete - and I mean, complete - lack of presence, support and interaction by wildcard devs, admins or even support workers on their OWN OFFICIAL SERVERS. Having played both official and unofficial (and now running my own) I can honestly say that Wildcards approach is a bad joke. Myself and my admins give a lot of support (usually in terms of workarounds for Wildcards stupidity, I might add) and we all work full time. Wildcard doesn\\'t even try. Take a look at their bug reporting mechanisms FFS. During my career, I\\'ve encountered small (less than 30 people) organisations that do far better with far fewer resources and much higher numbers of customers. As an organisation, Wildcard is appalling\\n2) Updates are Frequent, but almost always cause more issues than they solve, with most updates being aesthetic, superfluous nonsense. Updates ALWAYS result in the developers breaking more things - usually critical game mechanics - than they fix, resulting in server code that looks like the product of an incestuous relationship between Frankensteins monster and an evil goat to any professional worth a damn. The patch notes published by wildcards answer to Q & A in the guise of a blue haired buffoon, are also a joke with garbled or - more frequently no - explanations for the entries, spelling errors on items as important as server config commands (?!!), important items left out completely (presumably to facilitate them sneaking in unpopular changes, prefering their paying customers to find out changes for themselves...) \\n3) Game Mechanics are universally awful. This is - I am now convinced - the result of a severe lack of problem solving talent within Wildcard. Every time they encounter something - some way that the players are CHOOSING to play the game - that Wildcard perceives as problematic, rather than taking stock and looking at various SENSIBLE solutions, they almost always pick the simplest, most frustrating and game-breaking approach without considering the long term ramifications. This fact has been demonstrated over and over and has been a constant source of facepalming amongst those of us with any common sense; it really is like letting a monkey loose in the plantation.\\n4) The game is supposed to be - and was marketed as - a sandbox type, persistent world yet the developers are - more and more - steering the players towards a narrower and narrower gaming experience where building elaborate boats, playing solo and generally doing their own thing is being eroded. It was never their place to tell people how to spend their time and that they think otherwise suggests that someone in Wildcard has gotten a little big for their boots. When you fail to understand that ALL you have to do is provide a vehicle for people to have fun and instead start thinking that it is your place to persuade, cajole or hand hold players into playing a certain way, you\\'ve lost the plot.\\n5) Ark is so poorly optimised, even those of us with high end systems see quite abysmal performance, relatively speaking. To put this into context, to say that the hardware on which I run our unofficial server is overkill would be an understatement. However, the server still locks up / freezes on a frequent basis in the same way that official servers do. I see a fraction of the FPS that I see on other, more demanding AAA games. My workstation and server hardware & configuration have been analysed over and over. But in the end, examination of the server code reveals - and by wildcards own admission - that the game needs a lot of work.\\nHowever....a year on, we\\'re still seeing the same \"A bit further out...\" message in relation to optimisation. If you\\'re in any doubt whatsoever that it will ever happen, you\\'re right to think that way. After all, an organisation that puts the cart before the horse and thinks that making something look pretty should be a higher priority than making it POSSIBLE for people to play it properly in the first place may have dipped too far into the special educational needs inclusive recruitment barrel. Scraping even.\\n6) Abject failure by Wildcard to understand or even identify its player base, prefering instead to rely on some very misleading statistics. For example: quite a high percentage of players actually build elaborate boats (ships even) based off of the standard raft. Yet Wildcard saw that there was a high number of abandoned rafts on coastlines and elected to handle that by a) introducing a raft killer specifically to automatically handle the destruction of said rafts b) repeatedly \"accidentally\" crippling boat building by disabling players being able to extend rafts. This in a game where head mounted laser cannons (and even cannons) are touted as \"progress\" while in the real world we as a species had multihull boats for a millenia before the iron age! And yes, I know this is not supposed to be the real world, but it smacks of monumentally thick people at the helm when you feel raft building is an issue, fail to offer anything other than a wooden raft or a motorboat despite sea being more than 30% of the game map and mastery of it being essential for progression...\\nAnother example is the absolute failure by Wildcard to realise just how many of their players PREFER to play solo. Crippling those players through their engrams is - it has to be said - rather foolish.\\n7) I always felt bad for the poor Barstewards that play on console. Wildcard really doesn\\'t show them much love. It\\'s almost as if they are an afterthought, with patches occurring infrequently, late or not at all and with a number of features missing completely from their experience. I don\\'t play console myself but wildcards treatment of our console brothers is pretty appalling.\\nIf you are considering buying this game, my advice to you would be: don\\'t. It may be the case that Wildcard eventually pulls its collective head out of the horses behind, but in reality that is unlikely to happen. Whatever good idea this game was, has been swallowed up by repeated failures to listen to the customer, failures to establish even rudimentary support and infrastructure and a complete unwillingness to backtrack on its mistakes, fix them properly and learn from the experience. Such an organisation has no future, long term.',\n",

Yet at the same time, Ark: Survival Evolved never rose to the point of being a truly fun and engaging game.  Instead, it became a casual time-waster with ultimately no point.\\nThe game itself is gorgeous, and the worlds you can explore are beautifully crafted.  After encountering a game-breaking bug (more on that later) which ruined my initial Island game, and a bit of time in the Scorched Earth setting, I moved to The Center... and wow, that world is breathtaking.  Sure there are a few persistant graphical issues (purple rain, I\\'m looking at you), but nothing that seriously marred enjoying the scenery.\\nI really love crafting and building settlements and player homes.  That is one of the things I found most enjoyable in Fallout 4, and Ark: Survival Evolved gives a new and interesting playset to work with.  Most of my time in-game has been spent crafting, and I have some pretty homes and bases that I am rather pleased with to show for it.  Even if there really isn\\'t anyone to show them to.\\nWhich brings me to the core problem: \\nIf you play Ark: Survival Evolved, you are either going to play singleplayer, with a small group of friends on a dedicated server, or in the open multiplayer.  The last is, frankly, to be avoided at all costs.  The Ark MMO community is unimaginably toxic.  (And the game designers have actively promoted and encouraged toxicity.)  You can go to other reviews to get a full story.  That isn\\'t the point of this review.\\nThe survival elements of this game are very strong.  It takes a fair bit of effort to get to the point where you can sustain yourself.  But once you do, there is no plot.  There is no goal other than to build up to the next level of tech just to run around with different toys.  Mercifully, you can adjust settings to minimize the amount of grind, but even with those adjusted settings, the game is still at heart and MMO, and most of your time will be spent doing tedious chores rather than actually exploring or building.  \\n(And when you are alone, there is no one to really build for other than yourself.  At least in Fallout 4, I have NPC settlers to share my creations with.  In Ark: Survival Evolved, I finished building a grand room with a center table surrounded by chairs... and then stopped to look at all these chairs in a world where my character was the only human alive, and I thought, \"This is clearly a cry for help.\")\\nPlaying with a small group of friends on a dedicated server will allow you to avoid the toxicity of the MMO community and provide you with companionship that will drastically improve the fun of the game.  But eventually either you or they will succumb to the numbing realization that there isn\\'t a point to anything.  Without a plot, without missions, without goals or an end point, the game simply becomes stale.  And the lack of those things can be felt very early, giving the game a lack of depth and substance that is really required for an enjoyable RPG.\\nExploration on the beautiful maps like The Center can be quite visually enjoyable.  However, while there is a lot to see, there isn\\'t a lot to find.   Cool, new, unique places are abundant and I very much enjoy seeking them out.  But once you are there, they don\\'t offer anything.  Just a few resources to mine which, by that point, you have multiple other ways to acquire.  In a way, these places are like empty gift boxes with magnificant wrapping -- the sort you see in Christmas displays at the mall -- more enjoyable for the promise you can pretend they hold than their actual substance.\\nThe best part of Ark: Survival Evolved is the mods.  The modding community has built a lot of incredible content, and adding in mods breathes fresh (if sadly temporary) life into the game, as well as gives you a whole lot of new toys to play with.  I would have abandoned the game completely long ago, but with mods that gave me great new options for base building, or which allowed me to tame and ride a dragon, I kept finding reasons to come back to it and play a little bit more.  And those mods often lifted Ark within enough proximity of being actually fun to sustain my interest for a while longer.\\nPS: As the game is designed to be an MMO, there are some critical issues with playing it singleplayer or on a dedicated server which the developers refuse to address.  One such issue is that if you shut down the game or teleport away from an area before the resources respawn, they will never respawn again.  This is a game-breaking bug, and the best way to avoid it is to set the respawn rate as high as possible and be cautious in always making sure the last thing you harvested or mined has respawned before leaving an area or shutting down the game.',\n",

       " \"I watched this game (EA) release with caution – early access has almost become a synonym for ‘take your money and leave you with a rubbish product’ but after watching a lot of streams/gameplay footage and looking into the game I took a chance. This game has lived up to all of my hopes and far surpassed some – easily worth the money and STRONGLY recommended to anyone interested in the genre as a whole.\\nIt is unfortunate that this game has such a solid portion of negative reviews. A strong majority of the negative reviews are complaining that it is unoptimised (as to be expected in early access) and that when they play on low the game doesn’t look good compared to the trailers. I have a decent computer admittedly but I can run on ultra quite playable (scale back to high + to be smoother though) and it looks just as good as the trailer so the graphics are there, the optimisation is coming. The devs are incredibly active and the game is regularly patched in relation to not only preplanned elements but bugs and community suggestions.\\nFeel free to have a look at my screenshots if you want to see what it looks like at higher (but not full) settings. \\nThe main issues I have experienced is the dino pathing once tamed can be a little rough, especially once you start getting more and more dinos. On more than one occasion our little hunting party of 3-5 Dilos ends up missing one who is later found with its head in a rock somewhere. Far from game breaking but something to be worked on a bit.\\nThe control of tamed dinos can be a little clumsy (Using whistles to follow/stop works well but changing aggression requires you to go up face to face and cycle through a menu) and it would be great if you could assign groups - if a hunting party of 5 dinos is in the same area as someone else from your tribe with other followers, you manually have to tell each of them to stop - using the 'stop all' whistle will stop all the dinos in the tribe, not just the ones you have following. Note this is quite handy as it allows tribe wide dino control (which has come in VERY handy) but an additional grouping option with 'follow/stop my group' would make things much easier.\\nAn option to remotely set dino aggression stance would also be a godsend - In a tribe where we have 20-30 tamed dinos, changing all aggression stances is a task in itself.\\nAs far as gameplay, there is very little I could say against it. The game premise is great, content is through the roof. The levelling mechanic I feel works quite well and gives a small sense of purpose that you build your own experience around. It also allows you to customise your character to fulfil the role you wish to play.\\nIt is probably best to watch a few videos on taming and other core mechanics so you don’t waste your time as some things in this game do require a large commitment. Overall I think taming works well but do note that taming large dinos is a massive effort... A small Dilo may take 10-20 minutes to tame but once you start going bigger, it starts hurting. Larger herbivores (Trike, stego etc) take over an hour. Our T Rex took 3ish hours and our Bronto took a whopping 4.5 hours to tame (During which time you manage a two progress meters and defend from anyone/thing that comes by). While it is painful it does ensure that the apex animals are the prized possessions they should be.\\nContent wise... I have played a fair bit and haven’t even scratched the surface. We have a small tribe and have built up a bit of a base, tamed a Rex and a Bronto as well as a menagerie of other dinos but still haven’t cleared through more than one small island on the map. \\nOne thing that I am noticing now our base is expanding is the permanent impact you can have. When we first started our shack on the beach we were on the edge of a forest - Now the mountain is cleared and as we have built there it isn’t growing back. Very interesting sense of permanent change.\\nWhile we are comfortable in our little area, we still have yet to go into caves, the main mountains or deep underwater. I am currently sitting on 38 hours - The amount of time it would take to 'finish' all the content is staggering and more is coming. \\nWhile I normally stay right away from pure PVP (survival) games, this one makes it work. \\nThere are still a few of the sociopaths that seem to be everywhere online these days but overall it works quite well. I think the strong PVE backbone (ie. Dinos are bloody dangerous) tones the DayZ effect down a bit and makes for quite a good dynamic. There is still a deep distrust and caution applied when meeting other random people but it is far from a KOS-fest, indeed you will often find yourself cooperating while your interests align. (My tribe has been formed from me and one mate recruiting other stragglers)\\nPVE works great and levelling makes you far from indestructible (even low level Dilos can be an issue if your weapon is broken or you are taken by surprise without support). I have not seen the ‘endgame’ bosses (Super large creatures you summon with materials found on the largest and most dangerous animals on the Ark) but if you are into the MMO raiding style approach, that is there for you too.\\nThe beauty of this game though is you can make your own story - Having a tribe is great as it allows you to get larger scale things done (eg. building an expansive and well defended base) but I have equally enjoyed running around solo or with one other on hunting trips, operating out of small temporary outposts. The modding potential of this game is promised to be significant as the devs are giving access to their own editor for creation of mods \\nThis means that you can almost guarantee there will be a niche for everyone (have a look at Arma mods...) and will make the game playable (and even expanded) for many, many years to come. \\nEarly access is a bit of a minefield but over the space of the last few days with this game, I have had more enjoyment than I have with the vast majority of my other games and it has well and truly been worth the outlay.\\nHave a look at the trailer and a few vids - if your interest is piqued, it is worth the money.\",\n",

       " 'Ark Survival Evolved:\\nI have finally decided to review this game after 8400+ hours of gameplay in early access mode.\\nPositives:\\nThe game is a great idea. The way the game begins is tough… I mean really tough. It is a challenge to get started and anyone without any patience is going to struggle but I do have patience and to me the hard difficulty of this game was a real refreshing eye opener… but be warned it is not for the feint hearted. The best part of the game is the idea that you can breed your dinosaurs. This has been implemented in a really interesting way, where you can pool your breeding into achievable goals and breed out your favourite dinosaurs to have the stats that you have always wanted… but all this comes after you have set up a kibble base, and tamed great level versions of your favourite dinosaurs. I personally play on PVE and as you can see, for over 8K hours I have had a great deal of fun and I have met some fantastic friends in the community… This ought to be a great game, but there is another side to it that I have to address…\\nNegatives:\\nI am so sad to say this, because I have put so much effort into playing this game legitimately and have done my best to help create a wonderful community and support network on a great PVE server… however, the developers of the game have treated us long serving players with utter contempt. We have been completely mistreated, taken for granted, unrewarded, lied to, mis-sold to… under a cloak of awful communication and absolutely brutal and dire decisions that have kicked the games player base in the teeth. The scenario now is that the devs were going to cull the lowest 10% of ghost servers… and instead have decided to wipe over 33% of servers with medium traffic to consolidate their server lists and re-use these to plonk new servers on that do not have the same issues that the old servers had, and then to cap it all, any support for the old servers and the long serving players who play on those servers is to be canned so that we are on our own if we lose a character or experience any technical issues… This is a huge let down of the Ark gaming community, and sadly it is pretty irrelevant, because any support I have needed in my 8K+ hours has been utterly non-existent anyway. I reported a serious harassment case and followed every single instruction to the letter, and no action was taken against the wrong-doers. This was a shameful let down and completely spoiled my enjoyment of the game… The devs carried on doing little tiny favours for a select few gamers whilst most tickets were left completely unattended. I have colleagues who lost their level 100 character in transit and not a single effort to answer the ticket was made, that was over 2 months ago now. The sad truth is, that this team of developers and community managers, is sadly the most useless and incompetent and uncaring team that I have ever experienced in a game… so if you have any issues playing this game… do not even bother to report it… nothing will be done… this Dev team do not care. They care that they receive your money… they will go on to look after the new servers and make things look as though they are prepared to provide support there… but it is as many things are in ark… it is lies and false promises. \\nConclusion:\\nThis game had SO much going for it… it was a fantastic idea but the execution of the game and the choices made by the developers has left a bruised gaming community feeling ripped off and mistreated, un-respected and un-supported… and sadly their actions and incompetence in how they run their business has led to this review being a vote of no confidence. The way the legacy servers are setup now means that over-time the old servers will lose players and get wiped, so either old players stick around on current servers and wait for the server to die, or we start afresh on a new server and wait to be lied to and sit having no confidence that one day these new servers wont be wiped themselves… and that is the finding of this review… that ultimately, there is no point in playing this game, because it provides 10% fun, 80% grief and trolling and a final 10% of crying into your coffee as you hope your dino baby survives over the next ridiculously badly timed update that takes away something else that used to be a good idea. \\nDo not buy this game… do not play this game… go and play something similar where the developers actually deserve your money. \\nAddendum: After this review I was approached by a gaming website to do an interview looking into why I needed to play this game for so many hours. You can read that interview here:',\n",

       " \"Warframe is probably the best F2P game out there. It's not without it's flaws, certainly, but it's core game play is fun and engaging and fast paced and that's what really sets it apart. It's just fun to go and blast things. Even playing very similar missions many times over the moment to moment experience is always fun and frantic and that's why I've always kept coming back to it. \\nIt does have flaws. There's some grind to the game and while the variety of maps and missions has improved it's still not huge. Some equipment feel unique and interesting but some is pretty boring. For a new player getting the mods and equipment to really feel like you're making a contribution can feel like an uphill battle. But this is all mitigated a lot by just having fun running and gunning. \\nThere's always lots to do; guns and frames to build, resources to collect, loot to loot and bosses to kill. You're always progressing on something, just by running a few random missions. Unlike typical MMOs you can switch very easilly between styles of play and abilities so you can try things out and eventually will have access to just about every different style of play and ability if you want them. For much of the games content you can just pick what you enjoy and stick with it. \\nIt runs well on modest hardware; I'm running on an R7 360 and can get 1080/60fps with low/medium settings. If you have almost any modern graphics card then you'll be able to play this, even if you'll have to sacrifice the bells and whistles but it'll still look good. \\nThe business model is really very fair. There is almost nothing that you can't acquire simply through hard work and nothing at all that effects your in-game stats. The only really important thing that takes platinum (the purchasable currency) is storage slots for weapons and frames which are still technically optional although the longer you play the more you want to collect things instead of throwing them away. But this is offset by being able to trade loot items for platinum from other players. Being able to trade for platinum means that you really could play for absolutely nothing and you'd still be able to buy cosmetic items and slots. It's not easy, especially for a new player, but it's possible. You could never pay a penny and acquire every single piece of premium content. For a typical player you can spend $5 or $10 a couple of times a year and be comfortable and you'll never be punished for not doing so.\\nThe gameplay of being a space ninja is just fun. You move very quickly and can walljump and flip and run up walls to avoid enemies. You have space magic powers to hurl around. And you have the choice between rifles and shotguns to flamethrowers, rocket launchers, poinson gas throwers, black hole launchers and lightning guns. You feel like a badass splattering your way through enemies. Whether you are defending an objective, sabotaging enemy installations or breaking into enemy intelligence files but the core is always going to be obliterating swathes of enemies and feeling awesome. \\nAlso, you can get a space cat to attack enemies for you. \\nThe community is pretty good overall. Since you are all working on the same team much of the time there isn't the same kind of hostility you see elsewhere. There's still jerks (it's still the internet) but since you share goals and missions are short it's easier just to cooperate which makes for a better experience.\\nIt's a good game. It's the absolute best game that you can get as a F2P game. It's always engaging to dissolve a whole wave of enemies in a single attack.\",\n",

(and they will, trust me!)\\n2) The Warframe Wiki is your friend, and spoilers are appropriately marked. (and they are pretty big spoilers)\\n3) Do not level damaged mods. They will quickly be replaced by better versions. \\n4) Mk1 weapons can be bought from the in-game marketplace for credits ONLY (others require crafting) and they are fairly weak compared to a lot of the later weapons. get them anyway, and use them until they are maxed out, you\\'ll thank yourself later on for getting these done early.\\n5) Don\\'t try and make a weapon something it\\'s not. Weapons all have unique stats, and strengths. you can make a weapon that is strong in one way, (say, crit chance, for example) even stronger, but trying to boost a lacklustre stat is usually counter-productive and wasteful. Save yourself some heartache.\\nso yeah, TL;DR warframe is hella good, there is literally no reason to not try it.',\n",
       " \"I used to recommend this game, like a lot, and I wish I could still continue to recommend this game. I really, really do. I love almost everything about it, from its gameplay to its lore to its graphics to its sounds. Even its customization is better than almost any game I've ever seen. I do not easily get addicted to a game, but this game managed it when I first came across it, you can see my proof of that by just looking at how many hours i've put into it. \\nBut, Warframe has been steadily slipping into a downwards spiral. A spiral of extreme grinding. Don't get me wrong, it gets plenty of content too, and that content is pretty good most of the time.\\n\\nBut despite all that, Warframe’s grind problem is overshadowing all of that content. It got some ‘Band-Aid fixes’ here and there over its lifespan, but overall it has been steadily getting worse and worse. And now it’s gotten to the point where I really can’t enjoy the game anymore. Warframe as a whole just feels like a giant chore now. Now that’s partially because I’m a veteran and I’ve got not much left to farm for, but this is mostly because of the extreme grind it just forces you through if you want to get anything in this game.\\nThere are other issues, like enemies tending to be nothing more than bullet sponges and annoyances, and the trading/recruiting channels being nothing more than tedious walls of text, but all of them fall into the minor category compared to the grinding problem.\\nWeapons, Warframes, Prime Items, Special Items, Event Items; at least 80% of the game’s real content is locked behind Time walls, Wait walls, Pay walls and especially RNG- and Grind walls. Now I could totally understand this to some degree, but Warframe has crossed that degree \\n. With drop chances that rarely reach above 5%, and most missions being very lengthy and tedious, you have to grind so very much, it just becomes ridiculous.\\nThis is even worse for new players, who have to grind \\n FROM SCRATCH. Not only that, but there is so little in Warframe in terms of tutorials and information, that new players (and sometimes even veteran players) will often find themselves overwhelmed and confused.\\nNo, I’m very sorry DE, but I can no longer recommend Warframe in its current state. It wastes an unforgivable amount of a player's time on mind-numbing and monotonous grinding and it ruins the rest of the game. Something really has to change \\n in order for me to change my rating and start playing this wonderful game seriously again.\\nEDIT: Since I wrote this review, some things have changed, some things have not. The recent Plains of Eidelon update is one of the amazing things that has happened. To my disappointment however, not enough things have changed for me to go and recommend this game. The grind is still too ridiculous, and the other issues are still going strong as well. In fact, the Plains of Eidelon, as well as Focus 2.0, requires a ton of grinding to progress in it even slightly. So, I think my review is still pretty on-point in my eyes, and thus it's still a no from me unfortunately.\\n + Great Visuals,\\n + Great Sounds and Music,\\n + Great Gameplay,\\n + Supreme Customization,\\n + Free to play,\\n + Has one of the better communities out there,\\n + Good lore.\\n - Enemies tend to be nothing more than bullet sponges and/or annoyances. Bosses are never really interesting and a lot of the times have invulnerability phases and one-shot mechanics.\\n - Trade- and Recruiting channels are nothing but tedious walls of ever-moving text,\\n - Overpriced Market Items, Trading prices and Platinum prices. Platinum is priced so ridiculously high that the only sane moment you can buy it is when you recieve a 50% or higher discount coupon from login rewards,\\n - Developers seem to mostly forget about old content and balance issues - like for example Archwing - in favor of constantly pumping out new content,\\n - A lack of ingame tutorials and information, to the point where you'll find yourself almost exclusively relying on the Warframe Wiki and other external sources,\\n - Connectivity and lag issues can become a bit common,\\n - \",\n",

       " \"One of the most amazing concepts for a game I've ever played that has been completely destroyed by the devs. Before I start digging into the bad, which there's a ton of, I want to say what an amazing one of a kind design this game has. \\nI played PvE with my boyfriend and his brothers on a private server for about a week and it was such an amazing experience. After my boyfriend took a couple hours to set up the server we all started playing together, and it was wonderful. Starting out on the beach with nothing and just gradually working your way up was such a fun experience. At first we were constantly in danger, always having to watch our backs, but once we created our huts we finally found some safety. But there was always that element of danger when we played and it made the game exciting. Every time I ventured inland in search of resources or dinos I felt on edge. I would be terrified of losing the dinos I had or the gear I took and I loved every second of it. The first time I went to the center I couldn't leave my boat because I was so terrified of all of the caros and raptors I saw lurking around the beach. And the first time I lost my raft to a leed was amazing because it was just a reminder of the constant danger of the world.\\nBut all of that goes away once you advance high enough up the tech tree. Eventually you get to a point where you don't have to worry about any of the dinos you run into. By taming Argents you're able to fly all across the map without ever being challenged, and the large carry weight means you can just bring a couple and mine all the material you want and head back to your base. The challenge goes away. Guns one shot a ton of creatures and flak armor makes it so you can fight most wild dinos in a melee fight. My boyfriend was able to kill an alpha raptor on foot with a pike and flak armor by just running around it and hitting it in its blind spot. Eventually it just gets to the point where you're grinding and taming dinos for no real reason since flak armor and longnecks are all you basically need to become immortal in this game.\\nSo after about a week we got bored of PvE, but there was still so much to explore and do. So we decided to play PvP to try and get the challenge back. The only problem is that there is no challenge in PvP, it's impossible to play and you'll just frustrate yourself if you try. Basically every server has a massive alpha tribe who owns a server, and they go on wipes to make sure that no one else rises up and challenges them. Imagine spending an entire day scouting out a hidden base location and grinding out resources in order to build it and than just having some hacker come along and esp it in the bushes. Hackers aside, the way the game is set up is designed to keep alphas on top and new players on the bottom. All the new stuff that is being added doesn't benefit new players because alpha tribes will never let you obtain them. They block off caves and put auto turrets there so that no one can go down there and get good gear, they place metal foundations in areas that have easy access to metal and crystal so that they don't respawn and other players can't use them. And even if you are somehow able to build a base, it's impossible for you to protect it. I had built a huge fortress with a ton of tames in it that me and my small tribe got that day. When we all logged of that night the alphas on the server  came and destroyed it all. By using the website Battlemetrics, they're able to get alerts sent to their phones when a specific player logs off or onto the server, meaning that they always know if you're online or offline. And because of this they will never attack you when you're online because it makes it a little bit harder for them (even though all their dinos and gear are 3x better than anything a new player can get). And the game is designed so that literally anyone with enough explosives and time can destroy your base (unless you're an alpha in which case you have an indestructible fortress with hundreds of auto turrets and thousands of plant x). There's no defense against this which means you're always vulnerable, even if you have a metal base with a ton of guard dinos.\\nThe devs just seem content to let their game die, every update they put out makes the game a little bit worse. Server transfers were the start of this game dying off. Anyone can transfer onto any server and bring any items they want, which means that alpha tribes can just raid on another server and than leave. Processes like breeding are impossible for a single player to do, if you don't log on for one day during the two week process than your breed dies. If you're not constantly watching over it and making sure it's feed, it will die. This means if you're a normal person and have work or school, than this is something that isn't possible for you to do. Large tribes have giant breeding rooms full of air conditioners and tribe members to feed them so this isn't a problem for them. And the biggest issue with this is that breed dinos can reach a much higher level than wild tames. So anytime you face up against an alpha tribes dinos its always going to be better. And now the devs have added a tek cloning chamber, which is also impossible for small tribes to get because the only way to beat bosses in this game is to tame multiple high level rexes and attack it at the same time. It takes 0 skill to do, all it takes is someone who has a ton of tribe members who do whatever he says. So people saying you need to get better at PvP haven't realized that it takes literally 0 skill to be an alpha. All it takes it tribe members and resources and you can overthrow anyone if you have the time.\\nMy last point is that the game literally punishes you for not playing 24/7. Dinos have to be fed often or they'll die. I had a high level argent that I tamed and it died the next day because I forgot to put food in it's inventory.  That wouldn't be a huge issue but food spoils, so if you go on vacation for a week and you're not playing ark the whole time then all of your tames will die. And if you're not online around the clock than someone will come along and destroy your base. And not to mention all the grinding this game makes you do. This game might as well be called Farming Simulator 2017 because that's what you spend the majority of your time doing. And than when you log off that night someone comes along and steals everything you farmed. If you want to try and go raiding you have to spend the whole day farming materials and at the end of the day you get 40 C4. Meanwhile alpha tribes can get hundreds of C4 within an hour due to all their members, tames, and the exploits they use. \\nAnyways I'm done with this review. It's sad to see such an amazing and unique idea turned into such a♥♥♥♥♥♥show. To sum it up PvE is cool at first but gets really boring quickly and PvP is a broken mess that you shouldn't even think about trying to participate in.\",\n",

       " \"I think I'll kick this off by squashing a few rumors or misconceptions, Warframe is NOT a Pay2Win game but it is in a Pay for Convenience format. What do I mean by Pay for Convenience? Every gameplay changing weapon, item, part.etc can be gotten through simply playing the game whether you're grinding for that specific resource or rare drop or not. Another feature is these 12/24/72 hour building periods for weapons, enhancements or Warframes. BUT HOW IS THAT JUSTIFIED?!? Well that's simple, this is a Free to play game and the Devs need a way to earn money, yet you can still get every item you want simply by playing and waiting. If you choose to spend money you can use it to rush foundry builds or outright buy items from the market or trade chat. Another thing to note is this game is still technically in beta (despite having a working ingame Market focused around premium currency) and receiving updates nearly every week.\\nNow that that is out of the way lets move on to the real review.\\nWarframe is a game about an ancient warrior race, they are called Tenno. (some may recognize this as the last name of the protagonist in the Dark Sector series, that game is also created by Digital Extremes an Warframe is seen as its successor) In a nutshell they are a group of Space Ninja whose sole purpose is to maintain balance of power in the Solar System. How might they do that? Simple, they slaughter hundreds of deteriorating clones, Greedy Merchants and Infected who are pretty much zombies of the aforementioned clones and merchants.\\nGameplay can be a mixed bag for people, Its generally Pve with the occasional pvp thrown in due to fan requests. You will have a Primary, Secondary and Melee weapon. This is simply to create versatility in your loadouts and to offer unique ways to approach the fast paced combat. Now I mentioned before grinding and waiting times, yes you will need to wait a few hours or days to build your new weapons and Warframes but its Free to Play so I'm going to let it slide.\\nI understand this review could be more concise, but there are so many more that do this game more justice than mine. Besides its free to play, you should give it a few hours and then decide for yourself.\",\n",

There are a bunch of planets available to you, each with sectors ( missions ) with different gamemods which you complete for rewards. The game uses tiles to randomly generate levels. Some planets have unique tilesets, etc. Has a bunch of different weapons and weapon types, each item has to be ranked up with XP. You can then mod your weapon/warframe/etc with a huge amount of mods to tweak each parameter to your liking. Has a lore, but there's no campaign as such, just a few story quests.\\nREAL MONEY\\nBasically almost nothing is locked behind a paywall in this game. The only exceptions I found are some cosmetics ( character attachements, color pallettes, animations sets ) and inventory size ( For weapon and characters ).\\nYou can trade in-game currency bought for real money to other players at higher levels, which means that you can unlock pretty much everything for free, which enough time put into the game.\\nNot only that, but you can get a -75% discount on Platinum ( Currency bought for real money ) as a daily login reward, and for 5$ you can get enough of it to lift all restrictions on the inventory size and buy some cheap cosmetics. Buying weapons/characters for platinum is pointless because you can simply craft, or acquire them otherwise.\\nSCORE\\nIf I had to give it a score, I'd say 7.5/10.\",\n",

I cannot begin to describe how happy I am with the growth of this game, it blows me away every time an update rolls out. The events are super fun, the weapons modding is full of tons and tons of options, there is an ever growing list of items and warframes... there is just so much to bite into in this game. I am a person who enjoys deep detail and stats and customization, and this game speaks to that need very well, in addition to its utter crafted beauty.\\nOh, by the way, it's totally free.\\nThe only place I find a little lacking is lore. They have done a lot of worldbuilding and set up a great stage for their characters but have not embellished them or the history of the world very much. This grows with every update, of course, but I feel it is growing much more slowly than the game itself is. I'd love to even just be able to read more somewhere, if nothing else.

You fight with swords and axes and guns and all kinds of weaponry.  Each Tenno, of Warframe, has a different set of powers to master.  Some Warframes may not fit your playstyle, but there are plenty to choose from; I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, there are currently TWENTY-FIVE DIFFERENT \\'FRAMES to choose from, and the dev\\'s add more on a regular basis.

Yes, microtransactions exist, but they take a backseat to the gaming experience.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, is available to non-paying players -- as long as they\\'re willing to grind.  Microtransactions consist of purchasing fully-built Warframes, Warframe cosmetics, or fully-built weaponry.  No advantage is obtained if you buy a weapon rather than construct it; it\\'s the exact same thing.

I feel tthat the developer has lost heart and now want to cash in on what they have in hopes that they can move on to something new.  So what state does that leave the game in... well pretty much a mess at this point.  Sure the developers are scrambeling to patch up game to try and fix a few things, but they hope that if they just slap a new UI on the game that they hope players won't notice the flaws.   \\nSo let's have a basic rundown of what we have\\nSo if you can handle paying the $60 price tag for a game that I don't think will ever be in a properly optimized release state and can handle the other issues I've mentioned then ARK is an all right game with great looking graphics and the potential for some great online fun under the right environment.  but if you can't handle these issues, then I would recomend staying away from the game.  \\n=== Original Revier ===\\nFirst of all I played this game back when they had the free weekend, and at that time I was on the fence with buying the game.  Yes the visuals are great and the concept has a lot of promise.  And I might also add that during the free weekend they were working their butts off to get patches out to fix problems that cropped up with new content that had been released.  \\nNow Fast forward to the time of the review and what do we have.  Well first of all, I still haven't purcahsed the game, and with the recent release of paid DLC before the games release with the notion that it's for testing purpose leaves a really bad taste in my mouth.  if they wanted to test the content and the underlying server tech behind it, then they should have released it free, and then set the price on the games release.  Also add in the fact that the DLC adds in unfair advantages that can be taken between the paid DLC and the base game, what does this mean for people who don't have the DLC, you're at the mercy of players who do.  And with ARK being a highly competitiv game there will be those who will set out to runin the experience for others.  \\nAs for the game itself.  If you're looking for a simple player experience there is one there, but if you actually want to finish the game that could be extremely tricky, if not impossible.  The game has designed in such a way that it's not something that can be done by one person.  you WILL have to go online and play on the ARK servers to complete the game or even get access to the DLC that you've purchased.  \\nWhen it's all said and done, I can't recomend a game that gives players a distinct advantage over others just because they paid money.  Games are supposed to be fun and entertaining.  I just hope that the developer sees the errors in their ways and at least adds in the ability to prevent content coming in from the DLC to keep non DLC Enabled servers fair to others.\",\n",

But by allowing someone to harvest materiels, build all the guns and ammo, and breed high level dino's then transfer all that to another server where a society and pecking order has been establish by many hours of hard work and conflict.  The players that are doing this are able to completly destroy a server in a couple hours, then transfer back to where they came from.  You then log on to find that thousand of hours of work has been destroyed by someone.  You have no clue who it was or which of the thousands of servers they came from.\\nI have tried for several weeks to figure out the thinking behind Wild Cards decision to allow these transfers and can not for the life of me come up with either a gaming or business reason to implement cross server moving.  The only possible reason is they have given up on further development and instead of announcing that decided to chase off as many players as possible so there was less back lash when the patches and fixes just stopped.  If anyone can give me the real reason I may consider changing my review.  \\nThis decision will go down as one of the biggest fails in game history.  I have uninstalled the game and will never buy or play another game developed by Wild Card.\",\n",

The wyvern takes 4 days and hardly any irl sleep to get raised and to get it as strong as possible. I have several. With the latest nerf, they have made them useless. Essentially, I lost sleep over something that was great that the devs made useless.

       " 'As of this review I have played for just about 900 hours\\nARK: Survival Evolved has become one of my favorite games and easily the best survival game I’ve ever played. Most of the time when you invest in early access you’re gambling on a game that can reach full potential or be forgotten by the devs as they make a break for it with your money. ARK is the first early access game that I’ve personally played that doesn’t feel like early access. It’s got a lot more content than most finished games. The developers are usually always coming up with new content to keep the game fresh and the base game is fantastic while only getting better (most of the time anyway). There’s a few big issues with the current state of the game, but I’m willing to give the devs the benefit of the doubt that they will try to balance it out before launch.\\nPros:\\n-Hundreds of hours play time either by yourself or with a friend. For $29.99 this game has lasted me much longer than almost every full priced $60.00 game I’ve purchased in the past 10 years.\\n-Many different dinosaur species to tame and more on the way\\n-Beautiful world that has great map design. Everything feels hand crafted.\\n-Building a base feels more like building a home rather than a hole to hide in until PVP\\n-Dinosaurs control well and you’ll really develop strong bonds with your tames (including incredible sadness if they die)\\n-Graphics are beautiful (if you can run them) and help immerse you into the well-designed world\\n-Forming a tribe can lead to fantastic friendships\\n-PVP is incredibly tense and when played well you can get into seriously intense action\\n-Very rewarding but difficult learning curve\\nCons:\\n-At times the game can feel like a chore. Lots of grinding and some taming can take more than 3 hours\\n-Very unbalanced PVP that can really turn most people off\\n-Kibble that can shorten tames are being implemented poorly (EG late game dinosaur eggs required for mid-early game dinosaurs)\\n-Giganotosaurus completely broken (turned off in my private server)\\n-Needs better optimization\\nAll in all ARK is a fantastic game. If you’re even mildly curious about it give it a shot. It’s been a game that has consumed all of my time and I love every minute of it.\\nI highly suggest staying away from official servers and try to find a nice unofficial one. They usually have better tame times and active admins can remove problem players fast.\\n ',\n",

I woke up on a beach to find him harvesting thatch. I turned on my mic and he asked if we wanted to team up and build a base, so I agreed because I  could barley get to wood tier on my own. We actually made a small wooden base on a beach going out and mashing our E button to harvest rocks. We got a relitivaly large stone tier base. We would take our dinos to go metal harvesting. A few days later we were taming a beaver so we could mass harvest wood. Then the most iconic situation corelating to the game happened. As you probably already guessed we got raided... It was a memer/troll tribe going out to destroy tiny bases and just f*cking with people trying to play the game. It started in a normal day, I was helping tame the beaver dino and then a tribe came to our base. They told us the get the F*ck out of \"Their\" beach. We said that we grinded all week but they kept telling us to get out. Then the just randomly shot our beaver and insta-gibbed it. They shot us and then got out a rpg and shot mutliple missles at our base that took a week to make. After that we rebuilded out of that area. We made another base in the mountains with cats being a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥we moved again. We had a great base with some good mid tier weapons and resources. Then we logged of for the night.... You can probably guess what happened next. We woke up on a raft in the middle of the ocean with poop in our inventory. \\nI love the game but its so annoying to grind and log off and get f*cked with.

Instead of letting players to have more freedom in advancing to higher lvl, DE pumps out nerfs after nerfs, removing game components, and the only thing they keep on adding are countless of useless items with slightly different stat from eachother, so people think they have a choice. DE used to be nice and friendly but then became so greedy and distant, while all these new players keep pouring in and buying platinums, DE isn't ever going to change.

I love this game so much but the dev already milking it for money. Warframe finally got a decent regcognition from a lot of people, but then the dev team made a u-turn and made a lot of players unhappy. \\nOriginally there were several well known problem especially with the games difficulty that was brought up over and over again and the community's suggestion for that was more end game content so we have more to do than just grind. Then came archwings raid, daily missions, and second dream update, it was the best time i had in this game, and i was pretty sure this game is going to blow up in popularity. Sadly the fun stopped there, it started with the warframes rework, most people were ok with the changes they made to volts and mag, then came the controversal patch where they reworked a bunch of other warframe all at once without little announcement and zero testing, some change were good, some were bad, the change was supposedly balance all warframes out so none would over shadow other, in reallity it's just a bunch of nerfs that made the op warframe unexploitable, and also made the already bad warframe obsolete. instead of fixing their problem, DE decided to keep going scrapped the void, changed the navigation (it is so complicated and confusing, far too unesscesary compared to the old one), and completely destroyed the dream.\",\n",

There are so many times in this game where something stupid happens and it literally has a domino effect on everything else. It\\'s immersive. You take ONE moment for granted while you\\'re mining, or picking some berries and out of NO WHERE you\\'ll get bum rushed by a large dinosaur who\\'s hungry and wants YOU and your TAMED animal for dinner.

I\\'ve been playing since Alpha and there are STILL snapping issues with buildings. You have structures that have clipping issues and make it difficult building things next to each other.

It\\'s understandable to have SOME issues with each major patch, and we appreciate how often Wildcard releases patches and adds things to this game, but this game is still by all means an Early Access title. \\nFor that reason, and that reason alone.

       " \"There is no clear objective in Warframe. Warframe is a game where you have to set your own, small goals, to keep you playing. They are consistently adding quests into the game to give it a bit more of a back bone, but besides that, you mainly keep playing through similar missions over and over again, killing similar enemies, in order to level up your Warframe and weapons so that you can eventually kill the same enemies faster or kill them in more interesting ways. With that being the case, Warframe is a grindy game and in order for you to enjoy it, you must enjoy the base feel of the game. If simply killing enemies isn't satisfying for you, then you will likely get quite burnt out on the game.\\nThat being said, Warframe has a ridiculous amount of content such as Warframes (kind of like classes, they have different abilities), weapons, and mods for both your Warframes and weapons, so you are sure to find at least one Warframe and/or weapon that you find very enjoyable to play. For me, I just like to theorycraft and try out different combinations of weapons, warframes, mods, etc. to create new styles of play that can not only be fun, but also very effective.\\nWhen you first start out, there is definitely quite a steep grind you have to get through and the starting weapons/Warframes are not all that exciting, but the more you play the game, the easier it becomes to unlock new gear and once you have at least some gear that is high level, it becomes easier to level up new weapons and Warfames you craft.\\nIn the end, I highly recommend trying out the game for a couple of hours and see if you enjoy the feel of the game, actually shooting enemies, using your Warframe abilities, or just cutting them up with melee weapons.\\nAfter 1200 hours (plus the number of hours I played before the game was on Steam), I will admit I am burnt out, I know the missions and enemies by heart, not much comes as a surprise, but I always come back to play when they release new content because this game is great for theorycrafting and adding all types of ingredients into a stew and seeing what the outcome is, and lucky for me, they are always adding new ingredients.\\nAlso, their cash shop system is very fair for a F2P game.

While there is a very comprehensive menu with lots of settings you’d never have thought to create in regards to the visual settings, even with a blend of medium to low settings I seem to max out on 15 frames per second with a few random glitches. While it is playable and no where near as bad as it was when it first came out, it isn’t ideal. If your system can somehow run the higher settings, then the game is incredibly beautiful and you’re going to want to take hundreds of screenshots.\\nBefore you start to play, you’ll have the option of creating your survivalist. You are presented with sliders for head, torso, leg, foot and arm widths, lengths and heights. You can change the colour of your survivalist’s hair and eyes, though you can’t really see your eyes anyway and the hair colours are kind of dull. You unfortunately only have one hairstyle, and I’m hoping that once the game leaves Early Access it will have several options to choose from. Honestly, the best part about the sliders overall is that you can have different character heights from all the other players around you, something that not even The Sims 4 has managed to accomplish.\\nAs you wake up in the world of Ark, you notice the many HUD indicators for survival purposes. Some of these include stamina, food, water, health, oxygen and your level progress. Watching and being aware of these is the most important thing that you can do in this game. If you have too low stamina, you won’t be able to run away from the raptor that is chasing you. If you have too low water or food, your screen will start to become clouded with the same red effect we’re all used too in survival games.\\nThese indicators can also be affected by the weather. Severe heat can damage your health, and running through a humid rainforest will take a higher toll on your stamina and hydration levels. A handy feature is being able to drink rain straight from the sky for when you’ve died and lost your waterskin or are too far away from a river, pond or the ocean.\\nCrafting is a huge component in Ark. If you’re familiar with Rust, the crafting system in Ark is somewhat similar. As you level up, you gain engrams that can be used to unlock blueprints. Blueprints ten levels ahead of you will be hidden, encouraging you to continue to level up to find out what they are. This system also encourages a lot of planning, forward thinking and just plain luck, as you can’t unlock all of the engrams at the same time.\\nLast but not least, the one major feature that distinguishes Ark from the many other survival games out on the market; the dinosaurs. Able to be tamed and ridden, a source of food and a way to make the resource gathering faster, they are a vital component of the game. As you learn which dinosaurs are dangerous and which are not, you gain confidence with your ability to survive in the land of Ark. Taming dinosaurs is an adrenaline-filled process that requires a lot of teamwork, but the payoff is worth it when you put a saddle on your first T-Rex and stomp off into the sunset. In a major case of art imitating life I accidentally seemed to have exterminated the entire dodo population at one point during my playtime as they were the only non-dangerous sources of meat in the game. Thankfully, it doesn’t take too long for dinosaurs to respawn and when they do they tend to respawn in the same places. This can either make your game raptor-filled hell if you accidentally build your base too close to their spawn points on the island, or very easy, if you build your base on one of the southern islands that no carnivores inhabit. \\nWhile the performance of this game is lacking and a few key survival concepts of the game haven’t been re-imaged from the other survival games out there, Ark: Survival Evolved is a very fun game that will fulfill your childhood dreams of having a pet Tyrannosaurus Rex, even if you lose everything and your tribe in the process.',\n",
       " \"Warframe is one of the best game I've ever played in my life. This game has so much potential that you can literally ask for anything from the developers and they'll do it if a lot of other players also asks for the same thing. I changed my review of Warframe several times because of this fact. I first started playing Warframe on late 2014 and I loved it. But then, I felt that the gameplay was way too-repetitive and easy and I eventually got seriously bored of it. I even almost fell asleep while leveling up my weapons back then. I started playing again on mid 2016 since I saw a lot of update notifications passed by and it just blew my mind. The amount of changes they made in the course of ~1.5 years is amazing and I currently have played way more hours than back in 2014. Unlike my old review, I'm still not bored of the game at all and it's definitely has not become a 'lullaby'.\\nNew player? Read the 'Common misconception' part below first.\\nWarframe's main advantage is its extremely active and communicative developers. They listen to their 26 million registered users (trying to point out it's extremely popular - I know not all of them are active or giving feedbacks) across platforms really well and they change A LOT of stuff quickly. They changed the parkour system completely, they added tons of new weapons and warframes, they added new landing crafts, they expanded the landing craft interior, they added new well-written quests that adds a lot of story element into the game, they added cute puppies and kittens, they even added space battles and underwater battles where you'll fly/swim around with an 'Archwing'. Feeling like there's no endgame content? They added the 'Focus' and Arcane systems to further upgrade your warframe and made it possible for you to beat enemies four times stronger than your maximum level. Want to see the dev's progress? They have the devstream and Prime Time stream on Twitch every week to give you the latest update on what they're doing and they'll tell you the upcoming update so you can hold onto their promises. This is the reason I said that Warframe has a huge potential.\\nNow, the most important element: gameplay. Warframe's gameplay is no longer boring or limited like back in 2014. Bored of defense/Mobile defense/Interception missions to level up your stuff? Now there's an excavation mission. Feeling like going sneaky-beaky like? Play your Mission Impossible theme while parkour-ing across lasers and avoiding cameras on Spy missions. Feeling like bored of every mission? Fly into space or jump into the ocean to get an entirely different combat system with your Archwing. Feeling like it's too easy? Go for the intense Sortie missions, Raid missions, or Nightmare missions. Gameplay varies a lot and the devs will add more in the future. They even said it's possible to make the game an open-world RPG one day.\\nBut is it all perfect? Of course not. With these massive changes, bugs are inevitable. Luckily, the devs responds very quickly to bug reports and they have plenty of hotfixes almost everyday. Although, some bugs are still not fixed nor acknowledged (e.g. you can go out from the duel room after you begin the battle, you can get stuck underneath your landing craft's ramp, stuck on mission report page, update failed bug, etc.). They probably only fix bugs that are reported constantly or mass-reported, or maybe it's difficult for them to diagnose the issue so it'll take more time to fix.\\nGameplay also feels a bit 'grindy'. You need to grind for a long time for almost anything. Your team will be able to literally finish anything in-game with the right coordination and equipments, so there's not that many challenge yet if you do have a great team. It will take a pretty long time to reach this phase (more money you spent = faster progress) so don't worry about running out of things to do until then. I would suggest to refrain yourself from buying everything with platinums (real money) so that you have some goals to reach. To be fair, it's what you do on almost every single multiplayer game out there. Grinding. You grind for MMR in Dota. You grind for ranks in CSGO. It's what keeps you playing - you need to have a goal to pursue.\\nGraphics and animations are (IMHO) top-notch. There are not that many games out there that can compete with Warframe's smooth fighting animations. Warframe's abilities animations also looks super dope. Have a barely-enough specs? Don't worry, Warframe is well-optimized since it can run on mid-class (i5 2GHz, 4GB RAM, NVidia 700/800 series) Gaming laptops really smoothly. It still looks pretty good even with the lowest settings. The only issue I have with graphics is when Mutalist Captain Vor came out. I always experience a significant FPS drop everytime he pops out even with my way-more-than-adequate specs. \\nWhat about the connections and player base? Don't worry about player base, you'll find tons of players as long as you keep your acceptable matchmaking ping reasonable. I play on one of the worst place to play online games - South East Asia (not a lot of gamers, terribly slow internet, expensive computer stuff due to import tax) for 4 months a year and I can enjoy the game just like when I'm in US. Pay attention to the amount of open squads in a mission if you want someone to join your game. Missions lacking good rewards often don't have any players playing it. As for the server connections, it's a bit more complicated. Just like Call of Duty, you need to have a Moderate or Open NAT in order to play with others. Setting NAT is definitely not with one push of a button so it might make some players frustrated. Connection also have multiple bugs that haven't been fixed, so be patient when you see everyone in your friend list offline or 'Network Not Responding' keep popping up.\\nNew players - including myself back in 2014 - often get discouraged to play the game as soon as we see the market. Everything needs platinum. New players didn't know about blueprints. They don't know about how easy it is to get the resources required for almost everything that can be crafted. They don't know about trading. This is one of the main disadvantage of Warframe. Devs need to make the game more 'interesting to see' for new players, not make it look like a Pay-To-Win F2P MMO just like others.\\nWarframe is NOT pay-to-win at all. You can only progress faster by paying, but it doesn't make you stronger than others. I know it's kind of tedious to farm for a Warframe, especially Prime ones. It's where the trading system kicks in. Warframe has a trading system. You can sell your Prime Parts found in Fissure missions for Platinums (in-game premium currency bought with real money). You don't need to spend a penny to get Platinums - all you have to do is just play fissure missions A LOT, sell your stuff, and you'll get your platinums. You can use it to buy anything you want (except non-tradable items and Prime Accessories), including the newly-released $70 Prime Warframes. As long as you want to do the trading, Warframe is very far from Pay To Win. You can also farm the prime warframes/weapons quite easily with the new fissure system.\\nOverall, Warframe is one of the best F2P game out there. It has great graphics, dope fighting animations, it's NOT pay to win, it has great potential, responsive & communicative developers, well-written story, and engaging gameplay. It does have a lot of bugs and some of them requires you to restart the game. I can tolerate this fact because they do make a lot of changes quickly and they do hotfixes quite often too. A lot of the players also complains that the game still lacks content and they'll have nothing to do after ~2000 hours spent in the game. But with the great devs, I'm looking forward to see what Warframe will become in the future.\\nThank you for reading!\",\n",

       " 'As of June sixth, the devs have released a patch that really fixed a lot of the optimization issues.  I have put over thirty hours into the game in two days.  I\\'d be playing it right now-- but I\\'m currenty at a place where the net\\'s just not that great so I have to wait. (Unfortunately, might I add.)  That being said; a review.\\nThe game is, to put it frankly, fun.  It\\'s pretty.  Animations are GENERALLY great.  The AI for the dinosaurs could use some tweaking-- I\\'d like to see the specific species given a little more flavor that\\'s more for them and the supposed personalities they\\'ll have once the game\\'s fully released; but that\\'s in due time!  So far I feel as though the devs have earned every penny I spent on this game.  It can be challenging going solo, however.  There\\'s an actual sense of progression to the game-- you don\\'t want to run into raptors before you\\'re ready for them.  Though once you\\'re in leather armor you\\'ll be able to go fisticuff with the lower leveled ones to tame them. \\nThere\\'s a few cons to the game, naturally.  I don\\'t personally enjoy the \"Sleeping\" players being in game upon logout-- though I can see why it\\'s a thing.  Personal preference.  Dinosaurs sometimes keep their momentum when you kill them, causing them to artifact or slide or fly away.  Your body can randomly die when logged out. (Either a bug or I logged out outside of my house and froze to death.) There were, of course, the maintenance issues.  There\\'s also the issue of no spots in official servers. (Just play on an unofficial one for now, honestly.)  I\\'ve leveled to 15 three times in this game already, having to start on different servers for various reasons.  However...\\nOnce I was able to run the game with higher settings with no lag-- riding on raptor back has become one of my favorite things to do.  I very, very seriously love just hopping on my raptor\\'s back and exploring.  I cannot wait to see player-made ARK islands.  I have yet to go to the very center of the map, but I\\'ve gone up and down all of the coasts.  Normally, I\\'m one of those players that gets lost in survival games.  The Island presented by the dev team, however, I find is diverse and unique enough that I can pinpoint where I need to go.  If it\\'s a new place, just look at one of the large floating colorful obelisks.  If it\\'s a familiar place-- I know my way around it.  I\\'ve taken to calling this little \\'U\\' shaped portion near my home \"Bronto Valley\" due to the fact it constantly has a Brontosaurus or two within it.  It\\'s just so easy to find my way around just by the natural landmarks alone.  \\nI feel that the crafting leaves a little bit to desire-- and I always welcome more player/dinosaur customization.  I expect that these things will come along eventually, seeing as it\\'s an early access game.  The devs are just fantastic-- and I\\'ve noticed them more often than not commenting on the game\\'s forums helping players and making light jokes.  It is refreshing.  After the furious patching that was done to make the game playable, I do not worry about the developers pulling a Jig and running away with our hopes and money.

However, if you want to get into the \"official\" servers, I would tell you not to buy this game. \\nThe devs are way to focused on balancing non-essential issues like turrets and turtles, when they have a problem that has been going on since the very start of official release. Essentially, there are people who play this game a lot. They have maxed levels, and that is fine. They can, however, transfer from official server to official server...AND THEY KEEP THEIR LEVEL. This includes maps that are brand new. In fact, 3 days after aberration was released, I joined an official server because I thought I would take part in their cash prize to down the new boss. When I joined this server, 3 days after released, there were already max level players who not only had multiple high level tames, but pillared the entire map, making it not only impossible to build, but to even set down a campfire or sleeping bag. In this state, the official servers are literally unplayable. The only base you can build is a raft on a tiny lake, and that is if you can survive long enough eating berries and mushrooms while crafting thatch foundations and throwing them away.

As I run along I\\'m collecting lots of neat stuff but I\\'m only wearing a pair of basic cloth boxers. I have no idea where I\\'m keeping all this crap.\\nDay 2- Decided to put down roots. Tried to perfect my skills and build a house. Got attacked by a Compy but I clubbed it. Three more came over and ate my face.\\nDay 3- Tried to get back to my homestead. Got attacked by a massive crocodile. Tried to go back again. Got eaten by a T-Rex\\'s angry cousin. Tried one more time and got swarmed by gigantic mosquito bugs. This area sucks.\\nDay 4- Magically spawned in a new area. Has to be further north as its cold. And snowing. Got eaten by a big buzzard. Washed ashore in a slightly warmer region of the north. Used my skills that I had been honing while getting my face eaten to build a house. I\\'m currently inside it while two dilophosaurus try to bust the door in and eat my face. These guys are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\\nDay 5- After cowering in fear during the night I finally decided to grow a pair and protect my measly thatch house. The dilophosaurs ate my face. Made it back to the house and killed the smaller of the two. Decided to make a slingshot and fight the other from a distance and put my ridiculous amount of rocks to good use.

I\\'d like to think I helped weaken them with my club but ultimately Popcorn killed all three while I lay in the fetal position wounded and crying like a baby.

We\\'re collecting the hides in preparation for taming and saddling up a Trike. Irrigation is established and I\\'m trying to farm. Life is good and my face hasn\\'t been eaten.\\nDay 12- Tragedy has struck as Popcorn has been killed. As we were scouring the area for hides we came across a turkey. I was hungry. So was Popcorn. We attacked and things seemed to be going well. Until a giant tortoise looking dino with spikes on its shell decided to help the stupid turkey. I got disoriented trying to lead the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off tortoise away. Surely my Level 40 Popcorn would be ok against a level 6 turkey. Alas she wasn\\'t.

Patch notes would often contain hyped-up items only to be removed right before the patch was to be released (some of which have been in this state for nearly a year).  The worst part though, was the very clear lack of any basic testing.

But now chinese players with new steam acccounts with random numbers (example: 184375922659252) just take over the server and use aimbot like crazy, hack in you tribe, demolish your stuff and disband, kill, or take your dinos. Needless to say the BIGGGG waste of my life buying this game and seeing all your work go to nothing because of some hackers. (i got hacked about a WEEK after i and the whole server reported their account and i sent 2 Emails to the DEVS. So dont expect them to do anything when you have hackers on your server. I was on \"official Server 30B\". IT wouldve been SOOO easy to ban them, they all have damn random large number usernames and all of their accounts are form china. \\nI did report this all to the forums and a mederator gave me the DEV email. So i made 2 emails with 1 day of each other. Its been over a week i believe and not 1 thing has been done. nor have i had a response.\\nThey just want to put the game on sale, wrack in the money and leave. 0 response to any of their players.',\n",

I would recommend thinking twice about the game until they've proven the course of action they took was the wrong one, and fix it, lest it repeat itself at the community's continued expense.\\nEven the most civil of discussion on the topic is being deleted on Warframe's official forum, and when asked to speak privately with Void_Glitch, DE's community manager told him to speak with their lawyer. I won't abide that kind of behavior and neither should you.\\nDay 3 edit: DE have released another statement. They've chosen to dig their heels in and condescendingly refuse to apologize or retract.

It has some small flaws here and there, and getting well aquainted with its wikia pages is a must, but otherwise it has a great dev team that stays well connected with is community. The devs also are fairly transparent by way of including weekly livestreams concerning upcomming content and the state of the game.\\nWell what are you waiting for? Pick it up and give it a go!',\n",
       " 'The game was good.  It still has a lot of bugs that need to be sorted.  The biggest problem this game has at the moment is that it has DLC available and it still has not left early access due to bugs in the base game.\\nHow can you produce a expansion to a game that is not finished being developed yet?   This should be default content due to the \"Early Access\" state of the game.\\nEnough about that though. Here is my biggest issue with this game and the \"support\" software you are required to install just to play.  \\nThe anti-cheat software requires you to install a program that starts with windows, monitors all your open applications, monitors your keystrokes and data sent via your computer to anywhere.  We do get a promise that this information (that is sent to a dedicated server) will never be used in negative ways or to steal your information.  But any monitoring software that runs and logs keystrokes is a very very bad idea.\\nBasically if this information is there.. It is a danger to anyones security and privacy.  This information in any form...   It only takes one mistake and a devious person to get access to the system, be it intentionally or by accidental access (letting someone use a computer that is logged into the server.)  Voila someone could have all your passwords / card numbers etc.  So any software that monitors my pc 24/7 will never be installed.  (that means the anti-cheating system ARK insists on.)\\nIf I could get a refund for my game I would take it immediately.  I have no intention of letting that kind of monitoring be installed on my pc.  I would rather get repeatedly ganked and killed in game by cheaters than install that kind of monitoring software.  (If it only ran with the game it would not be so bad.)\\nI develop programs on my pc. I use virtual machines to test things and monitor how the pc is performing... This is how i tested the ARK anti-cheat software.  (I wiped the install of windows after i saw what it was doing and that it would not remove.  It caused me to kill a VM and install to remove it.)\\nSo in conclusion I say NO do NOT buy this game.\\nNB: I have never used cheats or hacks in ARK.  Whats the point of cheating to avoid playing a game?',\n",
       " 'DO NOT BUY ARK: SURVIVAL EVOLVED!\\nOn the games merits, it\\'s okay. It\\'s another \"Eat every five seconds, or starve to death. And drink. And make sure you aren\\'t arbitrarily hot or cold at any given point\". The game is horribly unoptimized, to the point that it becomes a pain to play. Constant hitching (it would kill you if you played online with other people), even on Ultra the game looks like it\\'s own low.\\nLet\\'s also not mention the fact that the game is incredibly tedious to play. Dinosaur taming can take anywhere from a real ten minutes to real hours. I don\\'t know how many hours because I just ramped up the taming so that I could tame things easier on my single player save file. You\\'re forced to sit there, and babysit this dinosaur for who knows how long while anything at any given time can come up, whack it once on the head, and kill it. Imagine doing that on a highly populated PVP server. Standing next to your T-Rex, stuck full of Narcotic arrows while you shove more narcotics down it\\'s gullet and it slowly, oh so slowly, eats meat. And a tribe of dwarfs (real people, mind you) comes along and one-shots it and gangs up on you and says \"lel, noob\".\\nFinally, lets not forget the most egregious example of bad development during Early Access: Paid DLC. The game isn\\'t even out yet, and the ARK devs decide to release a $20 DLC. That\\'s only $10 less than the base game. The game is still unoptimized. The game is still unfinished. The game is still boring in most cases and extremly grindy, not fun in a lot of cases. But the ARK devs do not care about you. They do not care that you have problems with your game or that you want something to change. They only want you to keep funneling them money by buying their lame DLC.\\nDo not support such low practices from developers. Do not support these developers by giving them more money. Do not let them think this is okay. Let them see how wrong they are by letting the only thing they care about, their wallet, suffer.\\nEDIT: The inherent issue with ARKs DLC is that it shows how widely divided and unfocused the ARK devs are. For months now, we\\'ve been getting these... \"things\" that make me question whether or not the ARK devs are actually working on the game (it was supposed to be finished in June 2016. It\\'s currently September 2016. Where is it?). Survival of the Fittest (a terrible, combat focused side game. The one thing this game needs is more PVP), the Center map (whille a cool addition, doesn\\'t need to be made. It probably could have been added to the main map in some way or another) and finally, Scorched Earth (a paid DLC that adds so little you question why it costs $20). They probably had to release Scorched Earth to try and make up for the lawsuit that they got hit with (and lost) a few months back.\\nIf you like the company making your game to get a lawsuit, lose said lawsuit and release unfinished, buggy DLC for an unfinished, buggy game, you\\'ve come to the right place.',\n",

       " \"Warframe simply put is a solid, well rounded video game. I spent a while trying to sum it up with a genre but it borrows from several. Mass Effect with jumping! It's a third person shooter/brawler that puts you in the role of a Tenno, a nearly extinct race awaking to find several factions ruining the galaxy and various shenanigans occuring that are for your detriment. Going on missions in various space stations, ships and planets using tons of weapons and warframes in a free2play game that looks and plays like a current gen AAA game.\\n+ Good Graphics & Sound Design\\n+ Large amound of varied enemies, unique styles and boss battles.\\n+ Procedurally generated maps with dozens of tile sets.\\n+ Very satisfying gunplay and indepth melee combat/combo system.\\n+ Fantastic replay value.\\n+ Hundreds of weapons covering all different categories and type & Plenty of warframes to get with very unique abilities.\\n+ Decent story and universe created.\\n+ F2P\\n- Lack of direction to new players after initial quests.\\n- Late game can slowly get repetetive.\\n- Minor inconveniences to be had if not spending any real money.\\n- PvP is currently Peer2Peer and very laggy with no tangible rewards for putting time into it.\\n- A lot of mechanics go unexplained unless you actively check the codex/wiki.\\nIn essence you are able to progress through hundreds of missions that are instanced for up to 4 players in a squad, completing random objectives in procedurally generated maps against one of the 5 possible enemy factions (or sometimes a combination!) This is a solid formula, with a lot of different planet/map tilesets, a ton of very well crafted rooms and a very hefty roster of enemies for each of the main faction. Combine this with the hundreds of weapons you can craft (varying from pistols to grenade launchers to crossbows to electric boomerangs to rail guns), 20+ warframes (classes with very unique 4 abilities, akin to a MOBA) to choose from, a very good looking engine and some solid gunplay/melee combat and you've got a fantastic game in it's own right. You level up and upgrade all of your gear with mods that drop from enemies constantly, so everyone can tailor their weapons and warframe to their own liking and you do get a very solid sense of progression. You can parkour around the maps, wall run, pull of some complex melee combos and act like a space ninja, or you can be moving from cover to cover, co-ordinating with your team and playing it through like a tactical third person shooter. \\nIt has a very good looking engine that stands up by todays standards depiste the game being nearly 3 years old (counting the closed beta) It's got a godly particle system, as well as full usage of PhysX, very cool looking units and maps and a consistent art style throughout. The sound design is very competent but the music stands out the most, there are several dynamic sound tracks when fighting each of the factions that change depending on how much combat is happening but they all sound very unique and cool to listen to in the middle of some hectic shenanigans.\\nThe kicker being that this is completely free to play. This is a hybrid co-op/MMO without the 1-9 button smashing on the keyboard and it relies entirely on your skill with the weapons, abilities and movement to be good. It being a F2P MMO esque game, you do have to craft new weapons and warframes which take time but due to how inherently fun the actual gameplay is, farming for materials or blueprints never feels like a chore and 99% of the time you'll be collecting more than enough materials just while playing normally. There's a ton of PvE mission types, some new PvP, horde modes, a space combat mode (think zone of the enders) and plenty of replay value inbetween. \\nThere are several story quests and tutorial missions to all new players a grasp on all of the basic mechanics however once the tutorials are over you are just sort of left to your own devices. The lack of constant direction might annoy a few players but I strongly reccomend just deciding that you want to go and check out a planet or get a cool weapon then work toward those goals, seeing new things and acquiring more equipment on the way. Planets have bosses, new planets need to be unlocked and so on so there are tangible goals to set yourself. You can create a clan with your friends, build a very large Dojo that can be used for trading, researching exclusive weaponry, dueling, storing event trophies as well as assisting in building solar rails for the very large scale PvP solar rail conflicts. \\nI would reccomend if you're really into it getting just a few dollars worth of platinum then buying a scarf, they're cool, because it's in space.\",\n",
       " 'For a free game, I had a lot of fun playing this. It\\'s better than I thought it would be.\\nThe Gameplay is great. It plays quite well, even with a Steam Controller.

If you though that Black Ops III\\'s Parkour was fun (which is not imo), think again.\\nThings called \"Mods\" lets you customize the strengths of your weapons, which makes combat much more easier on higher rank enemies. A lot of levels and worlds to check out. You name it.\\nThe game does have some flaws, though. Using my Steam Controller on some menus are unpolished. I couldn\\'t get out of a Success Screen, even though I was pressing B. When selecting a level, you want members to play with you, right? It shows that pressing \"X\" will make it so you wait for some people, but it turns out you have to press \"A\" twice on the level you want to do in order to wait. Yah...\\nOver and all, I can\\'t recommend this game enough! Come on, it\\'s free!',\n",
       " 'Warframe. I\\'ve come back to this game countless times when other F2Ps went bad. Digital Extremes is certainly interested in more than just profit, but in my honest opinion, that\\'s certainly always debatable. For now, I\\'ll go over the game and the company behind it.\\nWarframe\\'s gameplay, at its core, is quite fluid. You can cut enemies to bits with your melee weapons, shoot them apart with ranged weapons, and even approach a situation with stealth. However, exploration is fairly painful at best. At its worst, well, I\\'ve had moments of rage inducing issues with exploring the map as it currently is.\\nThe controls respond quite well, and you get used to them within the hour. The way you move through your environment depends on how you wish to traverse it. Simply running across terrain, wall running or climbing to get to high places or past distance gaps in the floor, or even the new Bullet Jump system that has been implemented to get more distance.\\nHowever, I would like to note that there are some ways to quickly traverse short distance simply using a rolling double jump or a roll slide. Having played this game for so long, playing catch-up with your more experienced allies is unenjoyable at best, so memorize this: Tap shift, and immediately hit control. Or tap shift and immediately jump. It covers distance quite nicely.\\nThe weapon variety in this game is absolutely rediculous! Why is it rediculous? Because there\\'s over 150 weapons in the game! Including \"Primed\" versions\". There are over 30 different frames as well, also including \"Primed versions\".\\nThe weapons go from automatic rifles like the Dera and Braton to powerful shotguns like the Tigris and Hek, to explosive-launchign pistols such as the Angstrum and Kulstar, to even whipes and blades such as the Lecta whip and Gram heavy sword. \\nWarframes provide very interesting choices as well. I\\'ve found myself enjoying Rhino Prime for his ability to soak up alot of damage. While other frames do it better, his abilities on display help him outshine others. I find myself using his Iron Skin with the Iron Shrapnel augment, which basically makes him a human claymore. His ultimate ability, \"Rhino Stomp\", also initially named \"Radial Stomp\" suspends enemies in a form of stasis, stick in the air. Jopkingly I\\'ve called it \"Hammer Time\".\\nMods are indeed in the game, but not as game modifcations like one would expect. Instead, they are cards you can use to increase the performance or your weapons, warframe, sentinel and/or Kubrow. You can get mods that increase helath, shields and armor, mods for powers, status effects and durations, and mods for mobility. Weapons have plenty of interesting mods to make for very fun builds, if making custom weapon builds is a preference you have.\\nYou can even make a rocket launcher a silent weapon with the use of a sound supression mod. Warframes can also get syndicate and Conclave-locked mods known as \"Augment Mods\", which add a bonus effect or power to each Warframe ability, however there isn\\'t a mod for all 4 for any of the Warframes yet. Having said all of this, weapon and character variety is certainly not in shortage.\\nDigital Extremes has been a standard to which I have judged most Free to Plays that have come out thus far. They put time and effort into their work. More than most companies ever do as a matter of fact. However, as this is a free to play game, like any company running a free to play, they must have a way to make profit. They do so with a very fair model. Almost everything in the gam,e can be gotten without paying a dime if you don\\'t go merchantile. The only things that can be purchased specifically with Platinum, the premium currency,\\nWhile the company has always been a ccused of questionable actions, Their handling of situations has gone fairly well. Being honest to their players and giving all the information they can to keep the community in the loop with them. They also do this through their weekly thursday night Prime Time streams, as well as their bi-weekly Friday afternoon Devstreams, which give out free 1000 Platinum rtewards during each of the aforementioned Devstreams.\\nLike any othe rgame, perfection is always the big lie. I\\'ll put up my complaints with the various parts of the game to let you all know what you possibly may deal with.\\n1. Repitition\\nThis is the biggest problem in the game so far. Repitition. You\\'ll likely burn out before you make enough progress to be content is you always use the same weapons and Warframe. For this reason, variety is deeply encouraged, so make sure to grow your arsenal of equipment as much as you can.\\n2. Balance and Effect\\nThis is a massive problem, not about weapons, but about the Warframes. Some are clearly well-designed for their purpose, while others, having been the first designed for that purpose are outshined by others. Mag gets my attention here, as her ability to perform anything in the game is continually dewbuffed to being next to worthless. Hydroid and one or two other frames suffer from this issue as well, reducing their worth to little more the Master Experience fodder.\\n3. The Map\\nI\\'ve complained about this once, and I\\'ll do it again. This thing is a nightmare to navigate. The only thing they so far have done to improve it is a full-on map layout to see where you\\'re going a little more. However, the issue of vertical detection on the map is still a fairly large problem, as it does not separate floor by flor. I already mentioned the idea of making a Metroid Prime-esque map system to replace the current one, but so far as I know, it remains on the back burner instead of where things are in need of adjustment.\\n4. The Grind.\\nGood GODS the grind. This is a traumatic experience at best, anbd most likely where you\\'ll burn out while trying to collect prime parts and just give up. While DE claims to be trying to lessen the grind, I fail to see that. In fact, I see the exact opposite happening here, as well as in certain other place with Warframe, in addition to nerfing certain mods, certain powers, and never certain guns that need it. This is where the game flops from a 7 story building flat on its face. While not anywhere worse than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from Firefall or Spiral Knights, it\\'s still arguably frustrating from time to time if not often.\\nMy thoughts on the game vary, but as you can see from my collective hours, I certainly lean more toward recommending it, if not a bit hesitantly.\\n8.5 Weapon/character/pet variety\\n9.0 Gun/swordplay\\n10 Movement fluidity\\n4.0 Replayability\\n100% Free to play, as advertised.\\nOverall, I\\'d give Warframe an 8 out of 10. This is Dex, signing off.',\n",
       " \"While I did enjoy this game, I am deeply disappointed on how things are progressing. \\nThe game is fun, yet unfinished. It might be unfair to complain about an early access game that is unfinished, but one has to wonder how an early access can have DLC. \\nThe game still needs optimizing, strong PCs get inconsistent frame rates, server is a chore to set up and needs consistent tinkering... I know , normal stuff for an early access... yet they have the time to develop a DLC. \\nWhen I decided to spend money for this game it was against the promise that the game will be finished, I expect it to be finished as soon as the developer is able to do so...but the developer is more concerned on how to squeeze every extra bit of cash from its supporters by launching a DLC for a game still in early access. \\nI don't understand why Steam allows such a thing. I don't mind paying for a DLC for a FINISHED game, but now I'm finding myself in the situation where I am a supporter for this game since its launch on Steam not being able to enjoy the full product as it requires DLC in EARLY ACCESS. \\nMind you , the DLC is installed on my PC, they force it in an update, yet I can't play it while it's using 8GB of my space. \\nIf gamers are accepting this from the devs we might as well just add a subscription to Early Access games where they can take whatever they wish from our credit cards with every patch. \\nNO, I don't care that the DLC brings a lot of new stuff to the table, I don't care that some people consider that this game is worth more, finish the fracking game and then add DLC!\",\n",
       " \"I Loved this game... until the devlopers began to hold its customers hostage with poor customers service, changes that really messed over the people that paid and help build the community and servers that wildcard never attended to. Lazy devlopment and now that is releasing they again are messing with the player base and punishing those that played long hours in Alpha and jacked the price up. I really think they don't care about their clients. In a game about dinos they are now capping number of dinos a tribe can have and making long time servers legacy without customer support. Overpriced for a 2 year early access game that now is charging 60.00 for something that was 6.00 a few months ago.\",\n",
       " 'So I just got off of a server, a guy with a 30 dodo army came up to my house. So what? The dodos, they slapped my walls, as they were slowly darkening the horror sunk in. I was a goner. As my walls collapsed the hope of escape went with it, I was surrounded, by dodos. As the dodos closed in on me I was saved by a player on a Argy, he picked me up out of my house and we flew away. He said nothing when I thanked him for saving me from my doom, we were going very far away from any place the dodo army couldn\\'t reach. He flew me entirely across the map with no breaks, and I realised where we were going. My name was Pepperoni at the time, the player stops and says one thing; \"I aem goinng tu cook u into a pizza\" and drops me into a volcano, (On The Center) and I was sure as I was falling I was about to die, but no, I was grappled into a cave in the volcano, and pulled back to safety. As I thanked him he said \"jk fam\" and punched me back into the volcano, expecting someone to grapple me again but I plunged into the lava I heard one thing, the squak of the dodo.\\nThe Moral Of The Story: 10/10 would get irrational fear of chickens again\\nEDIT: This review shouldn\\'t be popular ;c; its a tru story legitimately\\nI\\'d like to thank my cat, my cat, my cat, my cat, that cat I met on the road and was cute, that sabertooth that killed me, my Parasaur, my thatch hut, and my Mesopithicus... that other cat I met on the road and was cute, my Meowth ( Now a Persian :D) in Pokemon GO, and my cat\\nEDIT2: Heres an actual review: If youre reading this and planning to get the game,  JUST DO IT! And all the people complaining about Fps and stuff are just new gen gamers born with a silver PS4 controller in their hands. I play on a quite literal potato around 15 fps (if im lucky) and I still play for 700+ hours right now. All the negative votes right now are from some dumb controversy about them releasing Scorched Earth (A baller dlc) in early access, if they want to release it, they can release it yo. Scorched earth adds mythological stuff including DRAGONS and MANTICORES and GOLEMS and LITTLE KANGAROO RATS THAT ARE REALLY CUTE AND I DREAM ABOUT HAVING A REAL LIFE PET ONE AND NAMING IT DREAMCRUSHER LIMBTEARER THE THIRD! (Basically Australia simulator 2016) But really, Im not sure why people are complaining about it, its a fully working dlc, and this game really isnt very \"early access-y\" anyway, and thats a good thing. When it is fully released we have more amazing content to look forward to. Anyway, back to reviewing. If youre one of those people that for some reason gets *TRIGGERED* when something to do with dinosaurs isnt 100% accurate, such as the dinos not having feathers, I dont want giant chickens chasing me around, dodos are enough... too much... and Im not saying that a giant rex with feathers wouldnt be terrifying as hell chasing me, but It would kinda just ruin the feel for me... And its a fantasy game anyway, with giant spiders, giant yeti things, and dragons! So dont get triggered, is what im saying if youre looking to play this game. Other then that, official servers are infuriatingly hard, but play on them if youre just starting out, so if you succeed you can go get bragging rights at walmart for 50% off! And devs btw, if youre reading this for some weird reason, please add 2x, 5x, and 10x multiplier official servers! :D Its hard to find good servers with neat multipliers... But if you get angered and start looking at your pet fish menacingly (Im not sure why you would do that, but hey, I need to lengthen this review so I can look smart!) Anyway, you should get this map. Theres some really amazing workshop mods including Annunaki Genisis, Aku Shima, Ark Advance, Dino Overhaul, Mystic Academy, Jurrasic Ark, etc etc etc\\nThere are a ton of different dinosaurs, mammal things, prehistoric things, and they all look amazing :D A warning though, if youre new to the game, I feel as if alot of people need a warning to this, if you see a dinosaur (Rex, Raptor, or Carno (btw its Carnotaurus, not Carnosaurus)) thats colored red, black, or white and has some perpetual cloud of cheeto dust around it, its an alpha dinosaur. Theyre many times stronger than their normal counterparts and really will destroy you if you try and go give one a nice hug and calm it down. And no, you cant tame them. But this is turning more into a guide then a review now :c So basically, get the game, expect low fps, dont ragequit, and dont drink and drive.',\n",

       " \"After a single mounted saber tooth destroyed my tribes house and all of our belongings, I decided it was time to head out and be a nomad. Fully expecting to die on this journey, I didn't pay attention to where I was going, but took off. The first night consisted of making myself some armor and tools. After crafting a spear and collecting all the meet I could carry, I was off. The first day was a roller coster of emotions and close calls as I roamed the island from supply drop to supply drop. With each new loot box, I became more powerful and cautiously optimistic that this would work out. I found myself well armed and starving atop a mountain with a few parachutes I had just collected.\\nI did the only logical thing and dove off the mountain, soaring across a ravine and past brontosaurs like a scene from jurassic park. I landed next to another supply drop, and to my surprise, found the makings of a decent wooden house.\\nWith the ability to make a small abode, I decided traveling alone had gotten lonely, so i used my bow and tranq arrows to take down a small dilo, that would be named Mr. Spitter. Life was good, we traveled together and became close friends. Mr. Spitter had my back and I had his, but all of my gear had gotten too heavy, and the little dilo couldn't help much. It was time for a mount.\\nThe only mount of choice for a wander in this game is the raptor, its speed and lethality make it a perfect traveling companion. with some time and hunting, I brought down a raptor and tamed it slowly. So slowly, im fact, that I got Mr. Spitter a mate, and hunted with them while my raptor was tamed. I returned to the raptor just before he became a loyal companion to place my new forged saddle on him and rode off into the sun.\\nUsually this would be the happy ending, but in all survivor games like this one, there is no happy ending. Either you quit while you're content, or you live long enough to see everything taken from you. My new family and i traveled together until I found a supply drop under water. With the loot pulling me forward like a moth to a flame, I dove in the river and my trusty companions followed me in. Little did I know what lurked beneath the surface. Piranha swarmed us and devoured Mr. Spitter alive before I could even react. I pulled out my spear just in time for my second dilo to die. I couldn't let Speedy, my raptor, suffer the same fate. In a flurry of thrusts, I managed to save Speedy by a hair. The loot that laid inside contained the remaining pieces i needed for a house. \\nFilled with sorrow, I decided it was time to head home and rebuild a base for my tribe, but I soon realized I was lost. Speedy and I roamed for hours searching for landmarks to guide us home. I finally found the path home and eagerly followed the beach along the river to where I could rest for the night. Speedy was tired from running, and we were both to the limits of what we could bare to carry. I decided to give speedy a break and jump off, just to luckily find a stegosaraus egg. I thought it would be nice to return to the tribe with another dinosaur that we could all hatch and train together. I didn't notice the two large dinodaurs who were watching the egg closely, and didn't appreciate a stranger taking their young. THey were on me before I could draw my weapon. I had over encumbered myself, and Speedy counldn't move. I died slowly trying to drop the egg, and received the final blow as i attemted to join speedy to make my get away. As I lay dying on the beach, I watched as Speedy was slowly beaten to death by two enemies he should have never met.\\nMy wishful thinking turned to greed, and lead to dispair. I awoke at the shambles of our base, naked and alone, with nothing left to show for my time on the island.\\nHonestly a great game if you enjoy a true survival format and I highly recomend it to anyone willing to put the time in to get the rewards they want.\",\n",
       " \"Don't get me wrong, this game is overall a very fun experience. It's very addicting and once you tame your first dino you just can't stop until you get bigger and better dino's. The grind can seem a little bit too much at times but you can get onto a private server where most of the modifiers are turned up. Now to address the DLC. I refuse to buy it. How can a developer send out paid DLC before the game is even released fully? I would say it's a huge slap in the face to the gamers who have supported them. If the game was already out then sure bring out some DLC and maybe people will buy it.

You can play this on unofficial servers where things don\\'t take as long to accomplish, but either way it leads to my primary problem. Those that spend more time than you will always beat you, regardless of your skill. There is such a large spike of power as you progress gaining access to certain dinosaurs and breeding/eggs. \\nThe three servers we have played on have one to three \"alpha tribes\", aka the orignal inhabitants of the server. They are quite friendly to noobies, even gifting you awesome gear for your status. Once you become somewhat of a threat they become hostile and start imposing \"rules\" or some form of control. \\nAt this point you are forced to their will or you get erased. I have a prime example. The server my friends and I play on had this happen yesterday. There is one alpha tribe of the server. \"Some one\" killed the leaders flying mount. He gets a Titanosaur and literally erradicates the two most advanced tribes on the server simply because he can. Their characters will maintain their levels, but all their manifested work is 100% erased because some guy got mad. They lost literally 100\\'s of hours of work. \\nI played UO, I love the threat of losing \"work\" because it makes gameplay exciting. This game you don\\'t have a chance of beating the big boy on the block.  Say you are both max level. If you have played 100 hours, and he has played 500, he has 5 Gigas and you have 1. You literally don\\'t have a chance. If you can start pouring in more time than them, they will probably attack you. Most alphas have 1000\\'s of hours played already. \\nThe overlord of my current server has 13 tamed gigas(probably perfect tames + bred) an uncountable amount of other things. Every underwater cave is his. Every river is barricaded. You can\\'t tame a Quetzl without his permission. He has more resources hoarded than you could possibly gather in a month. If you make him angry he will tame a Titanosaur and erradicate you. So what does one do? You can either unite every other person on the server and still probably not even make a dent against him, server hop (as we did 3x now), or quit playing as I have.\\n**Added after original on 8/18**\\nFirst, I want to say the original review is not edited and only this was added. Second, thank you very much for the polite invite to PvE servers and those that tried to remain constructive with other options. I want to PvP a lot so PvE only is just not for me. For the rest, what follows is for you.\\nI honestly did not want to outright bash this game because I did not want to offend anyone, but the gloves are off. This game is GARBAGE. UI/storage/crafting are beyond GARBAGE. Net coding and registration of attacks are GARBAGE. You are honestly going to tell me spending 1000s of hours in left click simulator is fun? Are you good at spamming left click and using Google? Well you can master this game! \\nCombat is AWFUL. This is sub par Skyrim with no abilities or specializations at all. Want to fight in melee? Spam left click and abuse terrain! Want to attack from ranged? Abuse terrain and spam left click! Once you tame your Dino, you spam left click and SOMETIMES even a right click! I have played games all my life and this doesn\\'t even come close to being fun. \\nNot only is combat dull but takes HOURS of prep to get there unles you want to throw primitive weapons at dinosaurs. \\nNow for PvP. This game literally discourages PvP. The odds of me running into some one of my strength is EXTREMELY rare. In fact, with 240 hours played I got in a total of 10 fights at MAX. Only 2 of them were somewhat entertaining, running into a fellow noob and having a jolly chase through the woods with bows and arrows. I came for PvP, and 2 good fights in 240 hours? This game is flat out awful. If I kill a member of a tribe larger than mine, guess what happens? As far as trying to beat an alpha tribe, I\\'ve got better things to do with my life than spend 1000s of hours to beat a nolife. I don\\'t have the time nor the patience for this trash. I am a massive nerd and love games, but this is repulsive. \\nThe only way I personally see people like this is if you are an unexeperienced gamer or cannot get over the psychological thrill of progression and exploration.

Log off and hope the summer sale is still going with something good. You have now completed Ark, no reason to purchase.\\nThe main problem with this game is that it is a griefer survival game, not a dino survival game. There is not even PVP, you just get killed while your offline, that is it. If you compare this to another survival game you dumber than a box of rocks because not every game has to be the same, the devs can chose to do something better and make the game better than the others. I never saw one ad or comment put out by the devs saying, “hey come play this dino game and get killed in your sleep because that is “survival”. \\nPvPvE should be: Players in general engage in PvE however can choose to engage in mutual combat while online or engage in Tribal warfare, all gloves are off.\\nPvE should be: 100% player versus dino with no or little ability to harm another player. Restrict building around mines and resources areas to include other player buildings to eliminate griefing. Provide moderators to kick griefers and delete their characters from the server.\\nHardcore PvP should be: What the game is now. If you are so dang interested in dying while you are at work, at school, eating with your family, or sleeping then this should be the option for you.\\nThe griefers and midnight murderers are too dang spineless and carebear to be a real PvPer and hit the hardcore because at the end of the day, they are just a little ----- who likes to kill new and casual players.\\n-----Update as of 21 June 2015-----\\nI have since moved on to an unofficial server and successfully avoided the toxic nature of the official server griefers, which I honestly believe is sad. Why? Because the official servers should be the most opening to the gaming community by default and not push people away. The “official” server is what most players will click on whether they are new to gaming or survival games or whatever. I have also found that the unofficial server I chose does not generate a large population of players who log on consistently. Simply move you say? I may, but for now I am holding out. The only other problem with a random unofficial server is the ever looming thought; “what if the admin turns the server off?!?” Then your character and all you have built is done for. Try to know your admin in my opinion.\\nTelling the gamers who do not want griefing to simply go on a PvE server cupcake! is not effective. Have you looked at the data? Most players do not want griefing and most of the servers are in fact NOT built for PvE only. Furthermore, those who are suggesting this are assuming we never want to PvP. Wrong! I want to be online when the PvP happens and at least have some kind of story to associate the event with and tell friends about. What do I tell friends now? Go on an official server and you will log in dead--hands down. I hope you like to log in and see your characters cheeky rear because you will get familiar with it. I have also found that PvE servers lower MY FPS and I believe this is because of the hundreds of players logging in, building a hut and then never logging in again.

       " \"I started writing a review for why after a year of playing the game, I changed my review for it from recommended to not recommended; and it ended up being far longer than is a reasonable length for a review. It is not the proper forum for me to write four pages as to what happened to the game, and why I can't suggest playing it anymore. If you want to read more on it, I suggest going to the actual forums for the game (not through Steam, but through the official website). The players there are very active in posting, and there will be a lot of threads going in detail about the faults of the game, and talking about how DE's actions have never been further out of sync from what players want from the game, and from the direction they were once taking it.\\nInstead of writing four pages, i'll summarize it into something short and concise. Again, if you want more specifics, feel free to go look into them, but I'll summarize, as I have logged more than enough hours into the game to be very familiar with it, and what has happened.\\nWhat it really boils down to is this:\\nThe company is using grind walls, and severely crowded RNG tables to deliver content. Which is one of the least creative, and worst examples of game design I have ever played. It wasn't originally going to be that way, but that is what it has become now. And considering it is supposed to be an action game, and not an MMO/RPG, the grind really kills the feel of the game, you are much less of a Space Ninja saving the solar system, and more of a mindless drone collecting resources for new weapons, all for literally no reason at all, due to the lack of story. \\nIn my 20 years of gaming experience, I have never seen a company so unwilling to work with what their player base wanted, and just outright ignore them. The community is incredibly vocal with ways to make the game more enjoyable for the players, and keep them interested, and avoid just getting burned out on the game, and patch after patch, they go ignored.\\nFrom the past year of experience with this game, the current state is that it is a fantastic concept, being delivered in one of the worst ways imaginable, by an inadequate design and balance team.\",\n",
       " 'At its core, Warframe is a cooperative mix of traditional third person shooter gameplay, a great parkour system, and good melee combat.  After almost 3 years of active development, it has come a long way from where it started, and for that reason I greatly enjoyed it for over a year.  However, the developer\\'s latest decisions have, in my opinion, completely destroyed the game. To fully explain this I\\'ll need to separate this review into parts, as this a series of events as long as they are disappointing.\\nBand-aid patches may not be the egregious thing DE has done, but they\\'re certainly what have frustrated me and many other players the most.  A band aid patch is when DE attempts to solve a criticism by implementing some feature, usually a mod, that is a half-measure and that doesn\\'t solve the root of the problem.  For example, a new system called Rivens were introduced.  Rivens are modifications for your weapons that can only be obtained via the endgame missions called Sorties, or by buying them.  Once obtained, you must complete a randomized criteria to view which weapon it is for.  Then it will apply 3 positive stats like increased damage, increased magazine capacity, and so on, and one negative stat.  The system was originally intended to stop power creep by providing substantial buffs to underpowered weapons, but instead of doing so it instead just further buffed the meta weapons, created an even longer farm with more reliance on RNG, and in some cases even contracts itself making weapons do \\n. \\nThis is representative of DE\\'s current mentality of trying to solve problems with half measures, and never actually addressing the real problem.  This has been occurring for a substantial period of time, and there is no sign of it ever changing.  Although it may not be the worst thing for new players, I know it infuriates many veterans and it certainly is a large part of why I\\'ve quit Warframe.\\nAs previously mentioned, Warframe suffers from a tremendous amount of power creep.  Due to the prime system and even just new weapons, older weapons are rendered statistically obsolete, being objectively worse in every regard.  While that may not be the majority of weapons, there are many that are unusable past level 30 due to never being profiled buffed, and this includes entire weapon types that are never used and are only obtained for collector\\'s value or the mastery rank system.\\nWarframe does not have a traditional leveling system, but instead opts for what is called \"Mastery Rank\".  Mastery Rank, or MR for short, is the level of a player\\'s account and consequently the level most players associate with being a veteran.  In order to obtain these levels, players must level individual weapons and other items, further increasing the grind and meaning that players have to constantly switch to new weapons.  This honestly isn\\'t a bad idea, as it incentivizes players to change their play style and adapt.  However, weapons and other items needed for leveling have a tendency to be \"vaulted\", or removed from the game, punishing new players and making it harder to find a weapon they like.  If MR was simply a level this would be fine, but features, weapons and warframes, quests, and many other things are locked behind it.  \\nIn Warframe, there are certain weapons and warframes that are \"prime\", meaning they look different and have higher stats.  There are other variations as well, but primes are the most recognizable and sought after.  Because of the way the Relic system and previously the Key system are set up, there can only be a certain number of prime parts in rotation at a given time.  This leads to older parts being \"vaulted\", or in other words removed from the drop table.  After this happens, new players become unable to obtain them unless they either buy them from other players for exorbitant prices as they are in low supply, or wait possibly years for them to return to the game.  When they return, they are available to farm for a single month and are then removed from the drop tables again.  Oh but don\\'t worry, DE\\'s got you covered with a little system called \\n.\\nWhen either a new prime comes out or one is removed from the vault, Prime Access becomes available.  This a system where you can bypass the grind by paying prices that are beyond exorbitant.  At the time of writing this review, the most recent prime is Valkyr Prime.  To simply obtain the primary and melee weapons, it would cost  49.99$ with \"discounted\" plat.  For Valkyr and the weapons it is 79.99$, and for both Valkyr with the weapons and a 49.99$ accessory pack it costs \\n.  People will argue that this is non-essential so it doesn\\'t matter, but I would argue that DE has a vested interest in making the grind as hard as possible so people feel forced to buy this pack, and that making prices so astronomically high they are simply trying to exploit people who will buy anything they put out.  Now, if the grind was reasonable this would be questionable but not a huge deal. But unfortunately, it couldn\\'t be farther from reasonable.\\nThis.  This is what is killing Warframe.  To craft a single warframe, you must first farm for the helmet, chassis, systems, and in some cases blueprint.  Most warframe blueprints can simply be bought from the market with credits, the in-game currency, but some are dropped and some require extensive, resource-intensive quests.  Once you have obtained all four parts, you must craft the helmet, chassis, and systems, using resources ranging anywhere from reasonable to multiple months of farming.  After this, you must wait 12 hours for the parts to finish or you could just pay real money to skip the process.  Then, once the parts have all finished you must craft the warframe itself.  This process takes 72 hours to complete.  Once finished, you must buy another warframe slot, and the only way to do this is to pay with the premium currency, \\n.  You can obtain the premium currency, called platinum, by trading with other players, but doing so is time-consuming and will yield very little unless you are trading highly valuable items which you cannot obtain until far later into the game.  Once you have done this, you will finally have your finished warframe.  This process is greatly exasperated for primes.  \\nFor normal warfames, you obtain their individual parts by fighting the same boss over and over and hoping RNG gives you the part you need.  For primes, this is instead replaced by having to use keys which are obtained by RNG to complete specific missions to receive a drop based on RNG.  So much of Warframe is based upon RNG, and it is a large part of why the grind is so bad.  Thankfully the current prime system is better, but you can still expect to spend a while farming certain frames.  In the old system, I once farmed 12 entire hours for a single piece of a single weapon.  However, the new prime system hasn\\'t solved everything.  Drops are still dictated by RNG and things like me having run the same mission 50 times to get a single warframe have not been changed, and many systems still impede progress all in an attempt to force you to pay.  For a game that is praised for having a fair business model, there is an extreme emphasis on tiring you out with the grind.\\nThis current review isn\\'t even half of what I set out to state.  There are just so many things fundamentally wrong with this game that have never and will never be addressed.  The developer is complacent in making bad decision after bad decision and making money off the backs of what few people they still have on their side.  While it may not be as extreme an example as many other games, it\\'s still disheartening and downright sad to see a game with so much potential go down this path.',\n",

(Building pain, Survival is kinda of not a game aspect post the first day of play.  Lots of maintenance time sinks)   Dino feeding chores or they stave if you are offline to long,  Massive breeding time sinks where you have to be online non stop for over 24 hours to get it done.  Taming times can be insane.  Now you can go private server and adjust setttings.

Information as to what all was entailed in the addtion of Battleye via ARK (Wildcard)  wasn\\'t really laid out prior to the patch it came in with.\\nWildcard (ARK devs)  Drops this 3rd party software into their patch.  Battleye has all of its files put in place on your root drive, as well as within the ARK directories.  Basically all the parts of being installed minus a single command to imbed it into your kernal.\\nOn launching ARK you were prompted to Accept Battleye EULA. (Note the EULA was not listed to read it was buried in a file on your hard-drive basically hidden.)    So you were blind to what you were accepting basically.  Simply because it did not load or show up,  Battleye Devs said basically \"well its on your drive read it\"  Yeah....   The EULA stated \"upon installation of battleye you accept the EULA\"   Ironically the files are placed onto your drive, before you even were able to accept the EULA so you are forced to accept the EULA...    Devs say that putting Exicutables ect on your drive is not a installation.... yeah I call BS.    Even if you hunted down the files and removed them.  Each patch places those files right back onto your PC.  So you get to hunt down the files in multiple locations to remove them.   Also to note,  Battleye is installed at the Kernal level,  So to remove you have to have above normal PC experience to stop and delete services from Admin control command prompty via tryped commands.   Also to note, Battleye is self updating with no prompting and can change its operation as per what ever the Battleye devs decided to change it too.   Its a Very Large backdoor into your PC plain and simple.  Ironically they are quick to post saying their intentions are good and the strive to protect our info.  Yet they legally won\\'t place that into you know legal privacy statement or EULA......  Ironic\\nSo Battleye has a good bit of negitive crap on the net,  Battleye Devs claim its all hackers trash talking their service.  I wholely think the mass majority of it is crap stirred up by hackers.   But the Battleye Devs, are pretty much disrespectful to people with concerns.

But off course, if your not PRO battleye you are just \"Criticizers\" as per Battleye.  Basically everyone is a evil hacker and your not allowed to be just a player with concerns about their privacy.  Simply put the Battleye Devs are very passonate, but quick to aggression, un-professional and speak down to anyone with concerns.   Also note,  Battleye itself has been hacked so lets hope their not comprimised and we pay the price for the backdoor into our PC is not misused.\\nNon-Professional Devs in conduct and community communication (Battleye)  is the last people I would want to have a backdoor into my PC and my trust.\\nWhat Does battleye do? \\nBattleye Reads anything saved and ram,  If its in ram it can read it copy it and send it to the Battleye servers and saved.  Keep in mind, You have no idea what was sent, how long its stored, nor when they do it.  Also to keep in mind anything you do on your PC is copied into ram and left, as most programs ect do no unload from ram.  So  anything you have done that sit in RAM is fair game to Battleye.  Check some banking?   Hey look RAM saved info! \\nFile scanning?  Yeah pretty much no matter how you slice it, its allowed and can/will sifting through files.  Supposedly only Hacking files.....but they have stated sometimes other files get sent was well.....  \\nEULA is 100% protect Battleye and you have no leg to stand on or protection.  They have no Privacy Statement to protect your information (Check out steam they have a nice one to protect us)  But Battleye doesn\\'t want to be responsible if their software causes your information to be hacked or stolen via battleye\\'s own software backdoor on your PC.

       " 'EDIT: \\nThis review is a bit outdated, but the situation is pretty much the same, if not worse.\\nGame might seem fun in the beginning, but I would not recommend trying it as it quickly turns into horrible grind where you have to pay if you don\\'t want to play hundreds of hours of the same missions to see if you are lucky, and if you are - go grind for resources now (which also in many cases takes quite a bit of time) and after that wait several days until the item is built.\\nBut then at some point you are either burnt or unlucky and you just pay, as you get what you are looking for instantly and already built. With each update devs look for new ways to make you do that, while saying \\'yeah, we want to decrease the grind, sure\\'.\\nOriginal review here:\\nI guess it was fun while it lasted. It\\'s hard for me to write this after so long.\\nTo begin with, the game has great community and still has a lot of potential if many core issues are fixed.\\nWe started playing Warframe with my friends when it was not on Steam yet, like almost 4 years ago. None of them play it anymore just because of glaring issues that you begin to see after some time.\\nDevelopers are focusing mostly on new content no matter what. Game design issues that were in the game from the beginning are simply ignored or a band-aid fix is released which doesn\\'t adress the issue itself. Broken enemy armor and health scaling, useless weapons and Warframes aka mastery fodder, energy management is non existant, most warframe abilities either useless and nobody ever uses them or OP due to superb CC capability or straight invulnerability etc. and at some point get nerfed without buffing other abilities to compensate and so on.\\nEvery once in a while devs introduce a new system just to forget it for next year or two. Two-three weeks after it\\'s been released and almost nobody uses it, and there\\'s a plenty of such cases (Archwing, Dark Sectors, Conclave, Kubrows, Syndicates, Maroo\\'s Bazaar, Focus... seems like similar destiny awaits recently introduced Lunaro)\\nGrind, oh god, grind increases exponentially with each new update. I feel really bad for newer players. Devs tell they want to change the situation where old-time players have tons of resources and nothing to spend them on. And how they fix it - they release a weapon with crafting requirement of 30000 for a not so common resource called Cryotic. To explain, you can get like 100 Cryotic in 2-3 minutes maximum if you\\'re good at only type of missions where you can get it - excavation. There you have to defend excavator for 2 min which can be simply one-shot by high level enemy (there\\'s enemy damage scaling issues too, yup). Not to say the weapon itself is again a useless one.\\nAfter community uproar passed and people seemingly forgot about this issue, devs release new Primed Warframe with requirements for similar kind of resource (Oxium) of 14000 (by similar I mean the way to obtain it - you have to play specific missions to get it and amount is like 10 per specific enemy at best, and there are not too many of those enemies).\\nAfter another community uproar it was changed to 7000, which is still a huge amount for many people, and more so for newer players.\\nAlso Void, a place where Primed (\"glorified\") versions of Warframes and weapons drop. There were already many Prime Warframes released, and some of them have already been \"vaulted\" (taken out of drop tables). The official reason for that is there isn\\'t too much space in Void mission for many Primed Warframes and weapons, and not to create dilution in drop tables some Primes were vaulted. But from dev-team\\'s actions you can guess the real reason is different. There are several mission types in the Void that have little to no Prime part rewards and devs keep adding useless resources to the drop tables where they simply were not present several updates ago, thus intentionally diluting Void mission rewards.\\nAlso devs tend to put most desirable Primed parts into most boring and long (20 min) missions in the Void. And the chance for this part is like 5% or so, and guess what? It\\'s 5% for one of 5 different parts, making it 1% (if you\\'re lucky) for the exact part you want.\\nI guess it\\'s okay that people don\\'t want to waste 2000 minutes of their time to have a chance to get the part they need. Not to go too much into details, I\\'d say Void missions are not the only missions that have this problem.\\nRecently there was an update addressing most of OP Warframe abilities, and that seems to be causing another community uproar now, as broken enemy mechanics are not fixed and most of the time those OP abilities were used to work around those broken enemy mechanics. I\\'m not sure how high level missions (Sorties) or raids (aka Trials) will look like after this update as in some cases there will be no counteraction to nearly instakill damage any more, especially when you barely scratch the enemy\\'s health (lvl 100+ enemies).\\nEndgame here is like it\\'s either you relying on those OP abilities to keep you alive or you get one-two shot the moment you fail to do so.\\nTL;DR\\n- Devs produce more and more content (and bugs and broken mechanics too) and seems like they forget of even 2-3 month old content\\n- Ever incresing grind, with latest updates - exponentially\\n- Warframe abilities nerfs without fixing core enemy problems that were causing players to rely on these \"OP\" abilities\\n- Many initial game design flaws that most likely never will be adressed',\n",

The vanilla version of the game is riddled with bugs, from falling through the world to your dinos just vanishing before your very eyes (sometimes meaning MANY hours lost for nothing). The head of Wildcard Studios took a big hit when he was sued for breaking a contract with his previous employers, im sure this is why they decided to go ahead and focus on making a paid dlc expansion, even though it was sooooo the wrong move. you dont sell someone an unfinished game, tell them youll finish it, but then make them pay you for more content before its even finished or EVEN SLIGHTLY POLISHED. this game is so poorly optimized you need one hell of a computer to even get 30 fps. on top of all these things, every single update they push out, and i do mean all of them, something gets pushed back most of the time indefinitely (DX12 anyone?).

A pretty disgusting business move if you ask me.\\nI\\'d steer clear of this and other games by the same devs/publisher. Personally, I find this absolutely despicable. And if they can sink this low, I won\\'t even want to imagine what else they\\'d be willing to do in the future.\\n___\\nIt may be of interest to consider how this paid DLC comes out after Studio Wildcard recently had to settle a \"ugly\" lawsuit too (of which you can find articles through, e.g., Google if you\\'re interested in the vague information sorrounding it), that had been going on for months now. A lawsuit which allegedly started with a claim for $600 million, but that were (again, allegedly) settled at $40 million. Perhaps there\\'s some correlation there? You\\'ll have to make up your own mind about that I guess.\\nSome players state that the paid DLC was planned from the very beginning (which imo. is in its own right equally disgusting, regardless of how you look at it; \"Please fund us so we can develop a game idea, and paid DLC for it that we can charge you with later on, using said funds. Oh, we\\'ll also omit this little detail on our Early Access store front details.. oopsie!\"), and that it were supposed to release at the same time with the game going out of Early Access, which has been pushed back being that that game is not ready. If that\\'s the case, wouldn\\'t it have been a better idea to push back the paid DLC too? To avoid this distaste that people feel in regards to its release during Early Access?\\n___\\nNote: With my own account, I have only installed and fired up the game for the required 5 minutes needed to leave a Review here on Steam. I have however kept up with the development, on and off since December 2015, when visiting a friend to whom I gifted this game the same day I bought it myself. Basically, in my opinion, it hasn\\'t been ready for stepping out of its Early Access box, and I still feel that is the case as this is being written; which is also a large part contributing to why I never got enticed enough to install and play the game for myself. The idea of the game enticed me enough to want to support it early on, the current state of it however, put me off playing, repeatedly. With this paid DLC stunt, I\\'ve written it off as a regretful purchase, and one which Steam has declined my refund request on I might add (which is fair enough, as it was purchased in 2015; in other words, it\\'s well beyond 14 days of purchase).\\nAlso, to put it out there; I wouldn\\'t normally leave a Review like this, but I find it so absolutely despicable to put out paid DLC on a product which is basically considered unfinished—waving its Early Access flag proudly on its store front—that I felt I had to pipe in as well, on how I too feel this should be considered unacceptable business practices within the industry. And you\\'re obviously welcome to disagree with views on that subject. But at the same time, I would like for you to attempt doing one thing; and that is to try taking a step away from the fondness you may or may not have for the product, and to look at the situation presented in a bigger picture, one could even use the old expression; from \"outside the box\". Simply walking away, not voicing your distaste together with the masses that feels the same way, sets a precedent that this kind of business practice should be perfectly acceptable in the future. Not only for this game, but various other unrelated ones released under the Early Access flag as well. Is that a future you\\'d like to see come to fruition?\\nYes, critique on something you are fond of can be frustrating. Yes, a large quantity of negative, recent, user reviews may or may not have a negative effect on the future player base and sales of the game. But let\\'s be honest here, it doesn\\'t take a genius to see that this DLC stunt were going to rile up a portion of the consumer base. Especially with the Early Access title still lacking \"promised\" features, being behind schedule, having a myriad of bugs (which is fair for a E.A. title) and the studio involved in its development recently having to settle a legal lawsuit in the tens of millions (allegedly). These things combined are likely to create some confusion, and ultimately distaste.',\n",

       " \"I have played this game for two years, and have ambivalently enjoyed it.  There are many things it does really well -- the action and feel is great, when it's great.  And it's got personality, complete with your missiongiver (the Lotus) being creepily manipulative and codependent, and your ship's AI being hilariously Tourettesy and sullen.  The good parts have been good enough to overlook a lot of really irritating things.\\nBut, after years of playing this, I have to turn my thumbs down given the path it's been on for quite a long time.  The good has been shrinking rapidly in proportion to the bad, and, given that a game like this is one you play for the long haul, I can't recommend it to anyone starting out.  As time goes on, at least in the two years I've been playing, it has only become *more* buggy, *more* tedious and *less* rewarding, to the point where I wonder if the devs respect their playerbase.\\nProblems (short version):\\n1) The game has longstanding, serious game-ruining bugs that do not get addressed, while new content introduces new embarrassingly-bad bugs that should not have survived beta testing.  They just don't seem interested in fixing them.\\n2) The game is a grindfest, and that's part of the game and has been for a long time, and that's fine within reasonable bounds.  But the reward curve has been getting worse while the game has been getting more tedious and requiring more mind-numbing repetition of missions not interesting enough to sustain that repetition.\\n3) In their quest to extend game life and make more challenge, the devs have been creating artificial difficulty by, for example, creating missions that are long and tedious, and, rather than requiring skill, require patience as the players repeatedly engage in Skinner-box behaviors until the mission is finally complete. \\nPutting 2) and 3) together, the game is becoming a less- and less-rewarding Skinner box, and it's known as Trollframe to many players now because of its irritating non-rewards after extended, much-repeated tedious missions.\\nProblems (long version):\\n1) The devs seem to have become sloppier and sloppier.  Pretty much all new content is patched in with insufficient testing, and serious game-degrading/session-ruining bugs and frustrating glitches go uncorrected.  Most recent case has been the change of how enemies spawn in Extermination-type missions, in which you have to kill all enemies on the map to complete it.  Apparently, the devs found that some players had figured out how to complete these missions more quickly by stealthing them, making them able to grind faster.  Horrors!  So the devs immediately implemented a change that staggers them differently and makes some spawn well-behind the players -- sometimes at the mission start! -- making for a lot of time-consuming backtracking.  It also makes it so not all enemies are spawned by the time the players reach the final room of the mission, so the players just sit there from 3-10 minutes waiting for them to spawn in onesies and twosies.  It's disproportionately frustrating, like an extended, interactive loading screen that just sits there for a long time but requires your continued attention to progress.  This change has not been retracted 3 months after the fact, and it's not fixed.  Why not test it before putting it into production, or withdraw it until fixed, if it contains a serious bug?\\nThere are lots of things like this.  There are a lot of bugs that just don't get addressed, and some of them (like falling out of the map, which happens more frequently than it should) have no in-game remedy and are mission-ruiners.\\nOn the other hand, if there is a grinding shortcut, the devs are ON that, lickety-split.  So, instead of fixing the backspawning problem (making the player run all the way back to early parts of the mission to kill a newly-spawned mob, making the mission take a couple minutes longer with what amounts to a fetch quest) that has annoyed players for at *least* two years, they instead introduced *more* spawn delay and backspawn to thwart players that might be able to cleverly shave a minute or two off a mission (and, interestingly, completely avoid the backspawning bug).  From this, I can only infer that backspawning is intentional, and what bothers them is when players can *avoid* experiencing it.  Your priorities are showing, DE.  That one right there gets them a big middle finger from me.\\n2) The game has been increasingly oriented toward endless, frustrating grinding with worse and worse chances of getting desired item drops -- it's been getting worse, such that these days people commonly refer to it as Trollframe.  The game is grinding-oriented -- we all know this.  But the devs have increasingly been orienting the content such that it involves this sort of grinding: so-and-so mission will be available for 7 days, and you can only get X item from it.  You need to collect all its pieces from repeating a long, tedious mission, which has a random chance to drop them as its end-mission reward.  They've set up the drop tables (percentage chances of getting each item at the end) so you can get a couple of the items reasonably, but one of the items has a very low percentage chance to drop, so you pile up extras of the first parts while you get silly junk items the other half of the time.  So you repeat this mission twenty, thirty, forty times, til you're numb with it and despise it, but you're pressing that twenty-minute Skinner box button sequence hoping for the thing.  Grinding can be fun and engaging, but they've pushed the envelope too far.\\n3) In terms of actual gameplay, there's been an irritating trend toward more tedious and irritating missions and enemies.  The latest one at the time of this writing, the giant robot-dog Razorback, is a mission filled with bugs and made artificially long and tedious.  It's not difficult once you know how to do it, but it takes forever because of the way it is strucured (press this button, wait for bursa robot to jump down, knock him down and hack him, wait for him to disable Razorback's defenses, now shoot Razorback in a 2-second time window that isn't really very clear when it starts so you might miss it, and repeat 6 to 30 times depending on player DPS and other factors).\\nEh, I'm tired of the game looking more and more like a literal Skinner box -- that Razorback mission is almost humorously literal in being one.  Except we only have a small chance of getting our birdseed at the end, and I'm tired of doing it.\\nNope, can't recommend it.

The background narrative, in fact, will give us an excuse to put ourselves in the shoes of ninja called to fight a futuristic alien faction. Home menu you can choose between different worlds to visit where we await missions to complete possibly in the company of three other players. Challenge between intergalactic ninja! The objectives vary enough, but the main flaw of the title Digital Extremes is out soon given the limited variety of levels. You will be prompted to save the hostages, locate a reactor to destroy or find an object, but whatever the delivery, in Warframe you'll almost always eliminate waves of enemies, chasing the various waypoint marked on the map. The gameplay, fortunately, fairly obvious problems of repetition of the title. With the view placed behind our Tenno (the name of the metal ninja who impersonate), we will have firearms and trusts katana. Come into play the Warframe champions representing the different possible configurations of the armor. These identify the different classes of ninja, with unique features useful to customize the game experience. Challenge between intergalactic ninja! Initially there are three, while the other can be purchased with real money or get through the crafting system included in the title. The Warframe not only change the appearance of your character, but activate specific skill such as enabling stealth attacks, rather than providing armor thicker than usual and so on. The user then accesses to further customizations to buy with credits earned in each mission completed successfully. These enhance the efficiency of its Warframe but not only. There are in fact many consumable items to carry around for the later missions, useful to address the weaknesses of its configuration and style of play.\",\n",
       " 'Warframe is an amazing game, but it\\'s not for everyone.\\nGame overview:\\nYou play as the Tenno, master of swordmanship and gunplay, and \"pilots\" of the Warframes. In other words, you are space ninjas with super powers. Your objective lore-wise is to regulate the universe\\'s warring factions and maintain a balance between the powers. It\\'s a very fast-paced third person action-RPG shooter that is primarily co-op PvE. Your squad can consist of one solo Tenno, or up to four total. You can equip your Tenno with a Warframe, Primary Weapon, Secondary Weapon, and Melee Weapon of your choice. Collect materials and blueprints to build more things to equip.\\nPros:\\n-EXTREMELY incredible engine, everything looks and runs amazing even on low-end systems and toned down settings. \\n-EXTREMELY customizeable Warframes/Weapons. You can build your Tenno any way you want, and try a million different things to explore what\\'s fun and strong! There are something like 250 different weapons, and most of them are completely unique to one another. You will definitely find something you like that fits your playstyle.\\n-Movement and combat flow incredibly well. You are a space ninja. You can do anything.\\n-Everything is obtainable through gameplay. All weapons and warframes can be obtained through play with some effort, and the premium currency (for cosmetics, or insta-buys) is tradeable ingame, so you can get things that people want and trade for premium currency!\\n-Very good community. They\\'re always more than willing to help newbs with any questions or missions. Just ask in region chat, you\\'ll get hooked up with just about anything you need.\\nCons:\\n-EXTREMELY grindy. You will be playing the same, or similar missions, A LOT. Over and over, just to get what you need to make that piece of equipment that you want. Having so many build options at your disposal can somewhat remedy this (allows you to play a different way, even if it\\'s the same mission), but for most people it\\'s still a pain.\\n-Crafting times are in realtime, somewhat similar a mobile game paywall. It takes 12 hours to craft most weapons, 24h for some. 12h for warframe parts, then three DAYS to combine them into a useable warframe. Obviously that\\'s annoying and it\\'s a turn-off for many. However, you can still actively play the game and collect materials, mods, complete missions, etc in the meantime so you\\'re not BARRED from play, just takes a while to use the shiny new thing you\\'re excited for. Or if you\\'re willing to pay, you can rush the build time with premium currency (Devs gotta make money too :P).\\n-The developers are always paying attention and active within the community... but honestly do a pretty poor job of delivering what the community wants. Many times when the community asks for a change for something that\\'s usually completely necessary or there\\'s no downsides to it, the developers still won\\'t make the change without adding some kind of catch. \"Yeah, we\\'ll do this for you, BUT...\"\\n-Lacks any kind of thorough tutorials. There\\'s a ton of things that are vague and very difficult to figure out by just playing the game. You may as well just ask in region chat or look things up on the wiki if you\\'re confused, because you\\'re unlikely to find the information you need by searching ingame.\\nSummary:\\nOverall, personally, I believe this game is definitely worth the time if you\\'re the type of person who doesn\\'t mind grinding. The gameplay is just so phenomenal that it outweighs all of the negatives. The community ALWAYS warmly welcomes new players, and will usually stop on a dime to help them out with whatever they need! Seriously! Watch some videos, play it for yourself. It\\'s free, may as well try it!\\nIf you decide to play and need help, you can message me ingame if I\\'m online! IGN: CuteNabi',\n",

Just don't expect it to be any different after those first 5-10 hours.\\nSpeaking as a player from the Steam Release in 2013.\\nWasted potential: The Game\\nHorrible weapon and frame balancing.\\nDevs seem to outright refuse to fix fundemental issues with the game and are just content with piling more shiny things onto the garbage heap.\\nEndgame can be hit within the first 5-10 hours of play. It's just grind and scamming other players in trade-chat.\\nGame is incapable of being difficult without also being tedious at the same time (meat sponges; insta-gib-capable foes; forcing gear limitations; stat restrictions, etc.). In part due to the satisfying but ultimately imbalanced movement system and fundementally broken mod system.\\nMod system relegates player progression to the mercy of RNG's whims.\\nMod drop tables are over-saturated with useless things (like +7.5% radiation resistance) that absolutely nobody runs. If anybody tells you that they run those mods, they're simply horrible players or their mod count is lower than the number of combined digits across their fingers and toes.\\nStances; advertised as a long-awaited fix to the horrible melee system, were a disappointment and also relegated to the drop tables, futher saturating them.\\nNo variety in builds if you want to grind efficiently. Stack damage mods on guns; slip in crit mods if the base chance is 20% or more; put every power mod that would be suitable on your frame, then fill the rest with durability mods.\\nMelee has been awful forever and only serves as a mobility tool.\\nEnemies are either inconsequential glass figures or spicy meat-sponges due to the messed up scaling bought upon by the mod system.\\nDon't ever buy platinum (paid currency) unless you get a 50% off coupon or better as a daily login reward. It's horrible value for money otherwise.\\nFor the love of god do not buy the starter packs on Steam at their base price. They are a HUGE rip-off; only reason I bought the Tenno Pack last year is because it was like 75% off during winter sales and became excellent value-for-money.\\nWeapons and Warframes in the market are hideously overpriced considering you'll need to go through tens of weapons and warframes to rank-up.\\nPvP is an absolute joke. You know how in  most RPGs you deal a lot of damage compared to enemies, but also have a lot less HP compared to them? It's like turning party members in those games against each-other. You just run about instagibbing/getting instagibbed and finding ways to cheese the system.\\nEnemy variety is poor, with the only real distinctions being the differences between heavy troops and regular ones (the former of which is the only thing you should really consider when modding weapons as they're far, far more resilient than regular enemies).\\nThere's no pay2win, only pay2notgrind. Warframe utilizes a time-based gating system like those commonly found in mobile games. You kill enemies in missions, they'll drop materials. You'll buy the blueprint from the marketplace. And then you'll craft the item.\\nWeapons take a minimum of 12 hours to craft; clantech takes 24 hours PLUS the time spent crafting the pre-requiste materal (this can make the cumulative time of some clantech to be over 96 hours if you're dead-on with your timing in moving through each stage) Although there are many missions available which offer those special materials as rewards, massively reducing the total clantech crafting time. Warframes take a minimum of 84 hours to craft; get the helmet, system and chassis blueprints as random boss drops, they take 12 hours each but can be crafted simeltaneously, then combine them into the main warframe blueprint from the market, which takes 72 hours to craft.\\nTo be honest, I don't have an issue with the time-gating system as it isn't coupled with pay2win stuff like most time-gate systems are. Although some might, which is why I've explained it here.\\nThe good things about the game?\\nIt looks very nice. Although the atmosphere is non-existent as opposed to how it was years ago (go search for early-2013/late-2012 footge and compare it with 2014 footage).\\nMovement system is fun but is almost impossible to balance around without introducing tedium.\\nGunplay is okay I guess.\\nDevs don't do rollbacks whenever exploits pop up and are fixed. If you're fast, you can capitalize.\\nOnly real reason I'm still on-and-off with this game is, plainly put, some form of addiciton. Although I did quit cold-turkey for about 8 months earlier this year out of plain disgust with their implementation of the stances system. At the time of writing this, it seems I'm phasing out again. Whether or not I'll come back I don't know.\\nAlthough I'm looking at this from the perspective of a long-time player; so if you're new then you probably haven't become disillusioned with the game quite yet and will enjoy the bit that you play.\\nIt's like a worse version of Mass Effect 3's multiplayer.\\nAlso:\\nWarbros #1\",\n",

Add onto this a solid movement system as well as an initially rewarding progression system and Warframe should have the strength of core gameplay to barrel right through minor flaws of balancing or uneven progression mechanics.\\nUnfortunately, Warframe doesn't have minor issues with progression, it's infested with them. While most of the epynomous Warframes are all if not balanced then at least varied, the vast majority of the game's massive arrray of weapons exist only to level so that you can progress the weird and clunky Mastery mechanic whereby you get to take a series of uninteresting tests to unlock some, but only a few of the more advanced weapons. The mechanic does provide some advantages to levelling new weapons, but only once you're long past the point of painfully grinding a progression of dull nondescript weapons instead of getting to play with whatever your favourite is.\\nCompounding the issue, newer stuff is almost always better, and rather than spending any effort on balance, the devs created a system of random powerups, the variance of which is so massive that it will make weapons either embarassingly overpowered or actually provide bonuses to stats that the weapon does not posess. It's a mess of a system, and only the most extreme signal that Digital Extremes haven't got the faintest idea what to do with their game.\\nRecommendation? Play it for a bit, it's free, and the core gameplay isn't bad, but be very aware that you're far better off waiting a long time before spending anything on the game's ridiculously overpriced RMT offerings. further, this is no Blizzard or Riot game, don't expect well thought out development in tndem with the ridiculously priced monthly RMT content packs.\",\n",

The best quality about Warframe is that, for better or worse, they actually bother to make the changes. That's more than what can be said for a lot of other games out there.\\nMy biggest complaint about Warframe has always been the grind. The grind is ridiculous, something like 40-50 hours of grinding for a single piece of gear, which can be bypassed by spending somewhere between 2 and 7 dollars. Sometimes this gear isnt even good and you end up feeling like♥♥♥♥♥♥for bothering with it.\\nI have a lot of time in this game, so I can bypass most of these grinds by virtue of having enough rare stuff in game to either trade for it or have already farmed the rare stuff required. However, new ways to grind keep getting added. I've been playing since the start of open beta some 3 years ago. I've seen countless ways to farm nerfed to the ground and disappear from the community's knowledge. I've seen rare material drop rates globally nerfed, not once, but two times. I've seen new things added with sub-1% chances to acquire it, mandating dozens, if not over a hundred runs of the same mission. I've seen exploits exploited, and completely unfair and unjust changes made in the span of 8 hours, damning anyone who couldn't log in in time to prepare. I've seen all the worst Warframe has to offer and it's been pretty damn bad sometimes with the decisions Digital Extremes have made. But they live up to that name.\\nFor all the full on disappointment I've felt for Warframe, there are also awesome moments. Moments where people really come together and just be players in a game, discovering all the cool combos, hidden places, or fancier ways to murder countless enemies, together. That feeling of being in a new world, ready to discover whatever's next. That feeling that I only get from great MMOs when they were in their prime.\\nThat's where Warframe is right now, a great game, in its prime, ready to capture the imaginations of any player willing to give it a chance. If I ever get angry at the game, disappointed because whatever system was made too grindy, or some item made too hard to acquire, or a nerf hitting too close to home, I feel that because I care. I care about what happens in Warframe. I want it to be the best it can be, the game that I was meant to play and enjoy for years.\\nIts still that game that got me hooked. However, I cant enjoy it like I used to. Is it because the game didn't change enough for me to keep liking it as much?

The same bosses are encountered time and time again. Eventually the mastery levels and syndicate standings become meaningless, and become more of a tedious grind to get to the next one, only to be rewarded by more slots for weapons and such, which by the time you get to mastery rank 10 or so and enjoy the game, you've probably dropped about $200 on a prime access pack or some platinum, which you'll probably buy slots anyways then.\\nThe market itself features items that are insanely overpriced, and although you can trade for platinum (paid currency) it's once again a chore to acquire such platinum.\\nIn other words, play it to enjoy it for the few hundred hours you get on it, get something nice for yourself in the market if you feel like it, however once you get there, you're pretty much done as the updates are way too far apart to take any real interest in the game to keep it fresh.

I mean DINOSAURS! \\nThis game is in early access and changes should be expected. And in the short time I have played it there have been many additions. From new creatures to the TEK technologies. \\nI believe that the TEK technologies are too difficult to obtain for a casual Tribe (This games name for clans) and that the attainmnet gap should be much lower.\\nAnother complaint is the seeming total disregard for PvE servers. In the latest patch Ca. 31/3/2017 they instigated a patch that has dramatically reduced the capabilites in both flight duration and speed of the flying dinosaurs. This move has by a vast majority of the player base been rejected as making core game mechanics such as farming and taming which are core for the PvE community both for freebuilding super bases or running large breeding projects. This total ignorance of your player bases wishes in my opinion makes this game house no better than the total trash EA produces. \\nAs far as construction goes the game has a fairly extensive set of contruction capabilities which allow the creation of large pens, breeding capabilities, farming capabilities, large scale manufacturing and refining processes. It is by no illusion a seamless contruction process with v. poor placing mechanics and upgrade options. An example is in a recent building which I recently upgraded to metal (This is now debilitatingly time consuming to do with the flyer nerf) in which I has a misplaced wall during first contruction because instead of an internal wall snapping to the closer foundation edge in line with the rest of the wall I had placed it snapped to the further one which offsets that one wass by about a half foot. This at the time did not cause an issue with the building however when I went to replace the ceiling of that building with metal. The metal ceilings should have been replacing the stone ones and consuming them in the process. This did not happen, and after investigation I discovered it is because a single snap issue has messed up 10+ of Aviary construction and replacement.\\nI cannot in this games current state recommend this game to anyone. On June 2nd this game will have been in steam early access for 2 years... That is longer than the life span of most AAA titles. Despite this the developers frequently use this early access as an excuse for the extensive bugs in the game. The game as it is now could be released if they instead of developing MORE bugged features for the games focussed on a release candidate. Then released content after that.',\n",
       " \"Let me start by saying I really love this game. It's a great sandbox with survival, crafting, and dinosaurs - what more could one want? I've had a lot of fun times with friends (we have a private server) and this game gives you a real sense of satisfaction for accomplishing some of the more difficult tasks. Up until update 256, I would have recommended it wholeheartedly.\\nThen they nerfed flying dinos.\\nNow, fliers are REALLY important in this game. There's enough nasty stuff roaming the land that if you can't fly, you have to take a squad of dinos to get anywhere safely and it can take hours to gather resources which would otherwise take maybe 30 minutes. There's a number of dinos which are much, much easier to tame if you can tranq them from a flying dino rather than on the ground. Crossing oceans is way faster with a flier than with a raft. (There's only one type of raft and it can't be upgraded for speed or carrying capacity.) \\nI get it that fliers unbalance pvp. I would have been fine with the 20% nerf they were talking about. But what we got was much closer to a 75% nerf (dinos with 3k stamina went to 800 stamina) and a very low hard cap on movement speed. Most fliers can barely carry a rider now, let alone any significant cargo. Quetzes, the great (and hard to obtain) utility airships of the game, are almost worthless. One of the main effects of this nerf is increasing the time it takes to do anything in game; where before one could hop on a quetz and fly to another island to mine some obsidian, now one has to take dinos down to a raft, sail the raft over to the island, make repeated trips with fliers which can carry very little weight to shuttle the harvested resources down to the raft, then sail it all the way back. For those of us who can't play the game 8-12 hours a day, this is a significant handicap to getting anything done.\\nI've heard people say that the flier nerf makes players use land dinos again. We've always used land dinos as well as our fliers, because fliers are useless at harvesting most resources. Fliers are first and foremost transport, for the player or his land dinos, and nerfing air transport is a huge hit for everyone, not just the pvp tribes. I think it would have made more sense to nerf fliers health to make them less useful in pvp, leaving them still able to act as utility dinos. Nerfing both speed and stamina renders them worthless for pretty much any task and reduces players to a land-based game, which makes me wonder why they didn't just take fliers out all together if they were going to nerf them this badly.\\nWe're going to find worshop mods to run on our private server to fix this issue (very thankful for the active modding community!) because we love this game and want to go on enjoying our time playing it, but I'm pretty upset with Studio WC for handicapping all their players like this just to deal with one set of issues. If the flier nerf is repealed I'll change my review to positive, but right now I can't really recommend the game to new players because of how badly this update has screwed gameplay up.\\nOnce I get my quetzes back I'm going horse hunting, because those things look awesome. Until then I don't have the time to laboriously chase them down on foot across the dino-filled jungles. Last time I went hunting with land dinos I ran into a wild giga and lost my whole pack. That was a lot of bred dinos down the drain. I really do like this game, but seriously, Studio WC - the flier nerf is just too extreme.\",\n",

So it tells just how much of time can be put into this game.\\n800h on solo/own dedi rest on a unofficial dedicated with luckily good community. With nearing 3k hours of gaming in a year... I've played more than I have worked. It is just that damned good game to sink time. Still after all this time of enjoyment I cannot recommend the game anymore. The devs have slapped their players in the face many times and I still did not like how they did their things, but their lack of communication as developers is nearing the end of my patience.\\nI just like the game, but I cannot endorse bying it anymore. I lack motivation to bring more players to this game and I brought plenty to begin with. For to not recommend a game after such a long time of playing is hypocrisy, but it is honest opinion to the way this game has been going. I keep playing it as it is good, just that good to come back.\\nBut recent changes to the game ignoring thousands of player inputs which are much more down to gameplay than developers are just awful to watch. There is edge where different sides of communities collide, but they say their opinions more or less in constructive way, but they are all stumped by the arrogance of the devs not knowing their own game and how to deal with it. Developers implement things and have to patch it up for months so it works as intended and without breaking the core game after the update.\\nThere is huge gap between developers and gamers, something that only shouting can fix up. I cannot understand why did they take this route... If they worked with the community even a tiny bit more their game would be the best of two worlds, the way developers want it to go and how gamers see it best implemented for their enjoyment.\\n*-*-*\\nThis game offers survival with dinosaurs and a really good gameplay even with the bugs still haunting it. If one is persistent enough one will learn what to avoid, sure a tedious thing to ask for someone without experience, but at the core the game is a balance between gathering, taming and surviving. You can tweak it the way you like it and to your own   amusement. That is how well thought out the game is supposed to be, each to their own vision of that perfect gameplay.\\nBut with the amount of absolutes in this game... one cannot dodge things or have counters to things that should have, so the survival part becomes quite a daily chore. Had the devs even thought about the special abilities given in the past few months they'd see how frustrating the game has become. But to know about them first hand is something that startless the beginners a seasoned player has more chances to survive a surprise and recover, but even for them when most dangerous things are not the towering monsters around them something is awry...\\nEvery MMORPG player knows how lethal a stun and inability to retaliate is, but this game is more unforviging than worst of those I've played or seen played by others. There seems to be only one timer the devs think of... 10s. That is how long you are still and doing nothing when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan. Given the strenghts and weaknesses of different dinosaurs that is death sentence to some while others shrug it as nothing. Being on foot in this game is not something you do with pleasure, but are forced to by mechanics that are supposed to make the game harder. But while it makes the game harder it takes larger portion of enjoyment out of equation. Having annoyance is one thing, I'd shrug it off, but I've been overwhelmed by the amount of, or lack of, thought in these mechanics which are unavoidable.\\nSo what I did to counter these annoyances? I took more time in the skies I loved even before. But for now i have been taken that ability away, to enjoy third of travel means... Sure I can fly, but I don't enjoy it. On the same time traveling by waterways is even more tedious and while it adds a challenge it boils down to same annoyance as walking above ground, 10s  stuns and inablity to retaliate... Sure it boils down to avoid anything you know is dangerous, but it is not survival, it is artificial difficulty. \\nTo make end game players mortal while they should have atleast a fighting chance is challenge which I'd accept. But this game is detoriating from that, going more and more to the route that everything you do is death if done wrong. With the experience ( and gear! ) this far I can shrug off most of these with clever mechanics and knowing how things work, but they are not survival tactics... they are cowardly ways to bypass developers intentions of making the world difficult, but if their difficult is artificial, we, the players, will answer that challenge with all we can muster. And at worst... we stop playing the way we enjoy and just ignore content created for us.\\n*-*-*\\nThat is the bottomline of this negative review. For each 'challenge' we get, the enjoyment of the game goes south. If a game is not enjoyably challenging, it is just Cat Mario Evolved ( or games alike ). Something I don't recommend for a price of this game and hours needed to pour into it to even begin to enjoying it. This game is grindfest even when you get accelerated servers with all sort of mods to alleviate the grinding. But after you have grinded 'enough' the content given to you is just bunch of screw you thrown at from a point of view that has never played the game as 'just another player'.\\nI most likely keep playing this game, but I'm just not up to recommend it anymore. From April 2016 to December 2016 I would had... but now I cannot even if I'd like the company of friends to gather around. And this game is still evolving forward, something I hope will see mistakes from the past and change them. Potential is enormous, but attraction is waning fast if the aforementioned communication does not connect.\",\n",

       " \"Warframe is a great game, but it has lots of issues. I only suggest you play this game if you can tolerate grinding and are extremely patient. This game is an instance based mmo that offers great action based combat, with a nice sample size of frames(characters) to choose from. I will warn you now to ONLY continue to play this game if you absolutely ADORE the combat like I did. There is literally nothing to do in endgame but to grind for gear you don't need to make platinum(premium currency) or trying out new weapons and frames. You will spend hours upon hours grinding pointlessly.\\nI will tell you now, the frames are definitely all unique and fun to play, since that will be your only fresh of breath air throughout the game, Although the weapons are pretty stale. Sure, there are a lot of weapons to choose from... but only a small sample size of them are even viable in high level content, like 60 minute+ survival missions. In order to be relevant in raids you have to have mods that are very expensive to aquire as they are limited time items that only other players have. You will spend a lot of time doing nothing, as every time you craft a new weapon, frame, or quest item, it takes 12-32 hours to make in REAL TIME. You can of course speed up the process with some platinum.\\nI am happy to tell you that yes, you CAN get everything in this game for free. Although it will take a LOT of time. There is no auction house in this game, so you are forced to trade 1v1 with other players, negotiating and advertising your items. Again, more of a time sink, and in a sense, more grind, as you have to sit there and spam the things you are selling into chat until someone shows interest in it. It has taken me upwards to 5 hours to sell even highly sought after items, so be warned. \\nPVP in this game is laughable at best. You start off with no mods for your frame and have to participate in the PVP to get a chance at a good mod dropping that you can actually use. You can also buy the mods with platinum that you make from PVE content, which is probably the better route. So for those that like PVP be warned, you will have to endure getting smashed on by players who have invested more time in it than you to eventually be relevent. Even when you finally do get the mods you need to play PVP enjoyably, you will probably be highly disappointed at the fact that the incredible combat in the PVE portion of this game is not even taken advantage of in PVP. Every player you come across will literally ninja flip constantly and snipe you with high single target guns. \\nIf you can tolerate massive grind and the combat of this mmo is enough to drive you to play it, then by all means give it a shot.\",\n",

Visually, its absolutely amazing, and the art style is very distinct, with very identified personality between the factions. The combat may be glitchy at times, but it flows and shows a degree of freedom seldomly seen in other games. Movement is also very in-depth, wall runs, slide-jumps, and they can all chain together so that you dont just run anymore, you run, slide, jump, land, slide, attack slide, wall boost, land with an almighty smash of your melee weapon. By this time you commit these moves to muslce memory, your left pinky would be substiantially strong than your right one, so if you were plan to thumbwars with your pinky, i'd highly recommend this game.\\nGame play currently is very diverse, with several game modes: assisination or sabotage missions for those who enjoy Hitman; survival or defence missions for those who have nothing better to think about than SHOOT THOSE DUDES for 30 minutes+; boss fights for your inevitable grind for blueprints. Not to mention all the weapons and warframe you have, once you get to the 400hr+ mark, you'd have more suits and accessories than a spoiled-rotten 16 year old with her own creditcard.\\nThe bad- unfortunately, being any hardcore tenno require a lot of GRIND, as every weapon, warframe, needs to be grinded to level 30, and then repeat if you wish to forma(make it better). Not to mention all the grinding for material needed to craft the weapons and these awesome suits. Of course, it being a MMO, grinding is tolerated, and since I have 600 hrs in this game, certainly entertaining enough. \\nThe really bad- MONEY. credits and orokin cells are easy enough to grind for, but to get to the real end game(OWN EVERYTHANG), you need PLATINUM. certainly, you can now sell blueprints and mods, but that's very inefficient way to get plat.

So if you don't have a machine made in the last year or two prepare to invest  a minimum of $800 to play the game at at least medium graphics level.\\nSo if you're still reading this, my suggestion is to wait til the next summer sale and pick it up at a discount (and hopefully in a more stable state), the game was mostly worth it at $15 so if you can pick it up at $20 or less its something to consider, at $60-100, no, definatly not.\\nAt this point in time I do not recomend this game and you should stay away until it comes up for a deep discount (66% or more off)\\n-------\\nEarly Access Review\\nBefore I would say this is a great game, still is in a lot of respects, but putting out paid DLC on an early access game, diverting resources from key parts of the game that have been promised for months.\\nAll I can say is stay away until this is fully released, if it ever is, so you know what you're getting into.\\nARK was awesome a while ago but after the past few months it's been really stuttering and now this DLC fiasco is starting to have the makings of a money trap, with pay to play money walls.\\nSo Stay Away\",\n",

The developers put in a ability to transfer your character and poessions to another official server. Meaning if you want to go to a different server and bring some dinos, gear, and character level. you can, through on a in-game location called the \"obelisk\". What happened then was chaos and disaster and most likely be the very downfall of the game. When this came through, certain groups of people gathered all their stuff and went server to server to server to server WIPING EVERYTHING. These groups became so powerful on certain servers where people could not challenge them (slow progression made this a problem) they came into other servers and wiped everybody, meaning no bases or dinos or anything. These certain groups retain their power on the original servers but every so often wipe other servers and solidfying that no one will be as big as these groups want them to be. So you can work hard for as long as you like but its ether you get too big and lose everything so you have to stay under a certain limit BECAUSE of players or simply the timer ran out and its time for these people to wipe the servers. \\nYou might be thinking wow that sounds like hell there no way that is going on, the developers must of done something or are doing something to fix it. No its exactly whats going on because you can join almost any official server and see for yourself or even ask anybody in there and you will know everybody is just sorta just waiting to be wiped. The developers have done nothing, they wont even acknowledge it as a problem, in fact they dont want to acknowledge any of the problems with the game. There has been some rumors as well they actually want these problems to occur because if you look at the server list, there are so many official server with very few people on them. People are thinking the developers want this because they want people to quit and shutdown servers to cut cost (with how many hours it takes to get establish and lose it all most people quit the game in general). Even then they let there servers be disconnected that have been down for weeks and they have done nothing to bring them back and instead push forth Paid DLC? this early into the game development? \\nA kind friend bought me the game and its DLC because he wanted me to play with him and others. The DLC itself is a joke as well, the dragons (WHICH ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE DLC) can be brought from the DLC map and into the regular ark maps where some people can not have dragons because they dont own the DLC........Dragons are obviously superior dinos for their combat ability and all the advantages it brings (the certain groups of people i mentioned before ofc bring these dragons to other servers to wipe them). The map is also more difficult to start on and is harder to progress and by now anyone reading this, every server has a group of very well established people and wipes anyone they feel like and no one can do a thing about it no matter how hard or how long you try. The game itself never wipes but with certain groups coming in wiping everything or people who are already well establish will bring you down because they can and you will NEVER be able to retaliate.\\nI leave this game in complete dissapointment, this game could have been and stayed at being one of the biggest games played but more and more people are quitting because you can lose your many hours of work with some people having thousands, gone in couple hours with no way of finding a shortcut to bring that back.

Every patch that they released seemingly made the game worse, at least in my opinion. Patch after patch would only affect the largest tribes, completely ignoring the balancing issues faced by players who wanted to start their own tribes, or just play casually. I don't believe in my entire time of playing that I ever saw any significant bugs, abusive gameplay, or glitches fixed really. I was just expected to accept each patch because it would come with a handful of new dinosaurs that I couldn't have cared less about.\\n- Literally no concern for balance regarding small tribes or casual players. Servers set up and enforce their own rules. They even go as far as to completely block off areas which allow players to leave the server with their characters, which can ultimately destroy hundreds, if not thousands of hours of work for a player. The developers will do nothing for you on this either. I attempted to contact them serveral times myself, and either got no answer, or a generic one which ignored my problem followed by no response.\\n- Horrible optimization. I have a relatively good PC, and I was lucky to pull 30 FPS most of the time.\\n- Random and frequent server disruptions leading to dinos which take several hours, or even days, to tame failing,\\n- Server wars, in which a tribe which had a monopoly on another server would build up a massive force, and then bring over all of their dinosaurs and resources to a new server, completely destroying the tribes there if they were too weak, and setting up another monopoly there if possible.\\n- The game has a prisoner system in which you can knock another player unconcious, and then handcuff them and keep them in a cage. They cannot fight, run, or even die without interaction from another player. Their only hope is to spam global chat and hope that someone powerful enough to fight the captor might care enough to come and rescure them.\\nI'm probably missing a lot of cons as well, but honestly I think that whatever good you might have to say about this game, it's overwhelming outweighed by the amount of garbage you have to put up with in this game. I really don't advise putting your time into this game, tempting as it might be, unless it is on some sort of private server.\\n(Edit)\\nDisclaimer: This is only my experience and opinion on the game. I had a lot of fun with it in the beginning, but that quickly started to sour for the reasons posted above. I had several friends that played the game that quit before I did, and several that stayed long after, eventually becoming the server alphas. None of them ended up staying ultimately, and all of them have said they have no intent of going back any time soon.\\nIf you can stomach PVE, have hundreds and hundreds of hours to invest, or want to play on a private server or something, this may still be the game for you. In its current state, it just isn't for me, and the developers have shown no signs of improving it to that end, which is fine. This is their game, and they may have a large audience of players who disagree with me. This is just my opinion and warning to like-minded individuals.\",\n",

       " \"ARK: Survival Evolved\\nI would love to recommend this, but I can not.  Having over 764 hours in this makes it sound stupid, but that is part of the problem here. All that time went in alpha and beta and I expected there to be issues. I had a lot of funny and nice moments ofc. Everything is made for pure enjoyment. There is also good modding community.\\nSo why can't I recomment this game? I have a lot of reasons, after all this time this game even now, when it costs 60 euros and is released, is not fully optimised. Even on high end computer fps is crap. Graphics are great, but either wait things to load or play at low settings. Community, it is sometimes pretty toxic. There are soem alpha tribes moving from server to another and jsut ruining the game experience. And one more reason, the developers, they seem to not give a damn about the players. \\nThis review is for the people wanting or thinking to buy the game now. You might be disappointed if you buy this now. It is not fully optimised. I got it for about 20 euros back in the days, at that time it might have been woth the money. Of course if you do not care that much, go ahead and try it. It was good at times, that is why I can give it that good grade. \\nGrade for this game 7/10\",\n",
       " \"2500+ hours. Ran one of the top 10 servers in the world for Population. This is post is purely for feedback to the devs and those who wish to purchase the game.\\nPros: \\n* Dinosaurs\\n* Fun survival aspects\\n* Several tiers of tech\\n* Nice scenery if you can afford a 4000$ gaming PC\\nCons:\\n* 1) Constant bugs since release\\n* 2) Constant crashes in almost every aspect of gameplay (PVP is almost completely useless due to the crashing). Devs refuse to aknowledge or fix any of these bugs.\\n* 3) Mass forum bans from the moderators. No matter how innocent the post. the moderators will ban you over and over again (was once banned for politely asking another player not to plagiarize my server ad he stole word for word lol... Thanks for that moderators). The majority of the people posting on steam are banned for any and all reasons.\\n* 4) Worst ETAs i've ever seen. Patches are pushed back and back and back. Patches due to release on specific days are pushed back 14-20 times causing mass confusion and problems for server admins. People always argue that ETA are ETA. But the way to do ETA properly is to Figure out what you want to release in the patch, test it out, Then once it's ready and finalized give an ETA (will release patch at this time. And BE ON TIME!!!). the community, especially the admins will love you for it. I'd rather wait a day or two and have it release on time so i can update my server on time instead of staying up till 7 am in the morning to make sure my players can play.\\n* 5) Patches are NOT tested at all before release. Causing mass Wipes and critical bugs(swamp biome anyone? Invisible buildings anyone? lol).\\n* 6) Mass Hacking. No Anti Cheat what so ever.( yes it's coming. But it remains to be seen if it will actually work) Devs make a lot of false promises.\\n* 7) False promises. Devs promise one thing and never deliver. (1 of many examples; DirectX12)\\n* 8) Updates are almost always new dinos. there are 50+ dinos now. Most of them utterly useless. while it's great to have diversity, the map is overflooded with useless dinos. Make a bigger map of thin it out. No new tech, no diverse new gear(1 best gear for pvp, 1 best gear for cold..), no new game play. You can play the game for a week and get bored because of the lack of content.\\n* 9) Too easy to greif in the game. PVP has not been thought of very well. This gives admins a hell of a hard time upholding their rules.\\n* 10) Guns are Underpowered and unbalanced. A sniper does less damage then a pistol lol.\\n* 11) Major rendering issues. Have a base more then 6 tiles? Youll come within render distance and see EVERYTHING inside!\\n* 12) Dinos constantly disappear and vanish without a trace. Dino pathing is ridiculous! Needs a Major overhaul.\\n* 13) Developers RIP off mods, give the item a new name and claim credit for it(industrial forge? Industrial cooking pot?).\\n* 14)Developers are more obsessed on Hacking infested contests (survival of the fittest) and blowing away money to cheaters instead of focusing on the game.(this really pisses me off).\\n* 15)Coding needs alot of work server wise (people cannot find server on servers list, mod downloading issues etc).\\n* 16)Almost every single Admin command is corrupted and will glitch your game (force joining tribes, kill all wild dinos = crash etc).\\n* 17) Community is constantly ignored and treated like ♥♥♥♥ by the admins. Especially One Dev that starts with the letter N. I won't name him to not break any rules.\\n* 18) 2500$ gaming pc and Can't even run on full settings. Game is very poorly optimised.\\n* 19) It takes 30+ hours of non stop feeding to tame high level dinos and breed high levels dinos(officials). \\n* 20) Devs Repeatedly Add unbalanced dinos which ruin the entire game ( Godmode GIGAS that can destroy entire bases and 50+ dinos in 2-3 bites? WOW!)\\n* 21) Devs try to balance dinos by making them weaker then a ♥♥♥♥ing dodo bird?. Seriously? Absolutely no pre testing at all. Just another attempt at forcing players to grind for hours with Really weak dinos. this is not acceptable. Everyone has jobs, everyone has♥♥♥♥♥♥to do. Nobody can spend 10 hours grinding for 1 dino. That's not realistic. You're losing alot of good players because of this ideology. Grinding for hours doesn't mean skill.\\n* 22) Takes hours and hours and hours of hard grinding just to build a small base on official servers.\\n* 23) Several tiers of Tech is a good idea, but it was badly designed. Most people i know go from wood or stone to Metal because there is no point in the other tiers (waste of time).\\n* 24) Lack of community support regarding bugs. I've personally put in over 30 threads regarding issues which were all ignored by the dev team. Put a list of bugs you are currently aware of on a STICKY thread that way we know which to report and which not to.\\n* 25) build your base on a beach? Which 80% of the people do. Fresh spawns will almost always spawn inside your base.\\n* 26) Dinos falling through the world\\n* 27) Supply drops spawning above caves, or inside mountains.\\n* 28) Outdated supply drops for over 7 months. Supply drops are a big part of the game.\\n* 29) It takes on average 45-50 minutes to load the server list in the game's main page. How is anyone supposed to find a good/populated server when it takes that long to load?\\nTo Conclude. Ark is dying. It doesn't even have close to the same amount of POP we had 4-5 months ago. For example; only 3 out of the 200 people on my friendslist who used to play no longer play ARK. the most common reasons are 1) They cannot play due to the  bad optimization of the game 2) It's boring 3) Tired people greifing their hundred hours of grinding and hard work. In my personal opinion, everyone has moved on including the Devs. Devs have all but given up on the game now that they have raked in millions. The updates are slower and keep getting pushed back months after months after months. Promises made 5-6 months ago are pushed back till late August. Devs have made poor decisions regarding the way the game should have been built. Survival of the fittest? Great! Add that as a DLC or Free content after you've finished the core game. Instead of wasting weeks of development time on Dumb tournaments full of cheaters and corrupt players (Most of you know what i'm talking about). Further more, i appreciate that the devs release Q&A to the public. That's really good on your part. It's a step in the right direction. However,  i'm appalled at the moderators for mass banning people on forums, reddit forum etc. Calm down and Stop with the power trip. The community is here to voice their concerns. You can't og off banning people for no reason. Half the threads on steam are locked or banned because the devs don't want us talking about main issues (even those posting innocent comments get banned from people who abuse the report button a.k.a Spectre_06 Ertosi). The developers have made it very clear they do not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their community leaders. While ark is a fun game to play, it has too many problems and too many obstacles to overcome. The way that the population has been declining has proved this.\",\n",

The game gradually gets more boring if you're always put on a map to shoot someone all the time. Many of the maps are reused on different nodes and even different planets. To get the stuff you want you have to farm alot, possibly for a few days to get the stuff you want. Then you're forced to make it in the foundry. The foundry mechanic is very stupid as well. You have to wait to build weapons and warframes. If I am correct, it takes three days to build any warframe. So you probably spent about four to five days farming and then you have to wait another three days for a warframe. Minus a day or two if you're getting a weapon. I didn't come to play a game that makes you wait for stuff. The game also penalizes you if you don't play. Basically you can have pets and if you don't stabilize their DNA, they die. The thing is though, that this happens even if you're not playing. So I stop playing this game for a month and I see a new update. So I thought maybe there is something interesting (there isn't, it's worse now actually) and I see my in my inbox, there is a message saying my pet is dead.

There are frequent changes and updates being made to the game, being that this game is Free To play, the only reasons people wouldn\\'t download and play it for themselves is \"game memory size\" and/or download bandwidth limitations \\n.\\nFull disclosure, I\\'ve barely scratched the surface of the game (Yes, at the time I\\'m writing this review, I\\'ve only played for 20 minutes... and that\\'s barely scratching the surface!), but I\\'ve been getting caught up in other review projects and other games, so I don\\'t know how long it\\'ll take until I return to Warframe to continue my progress. That detail will either qualify or disqualify my review in many people\\'s eyes, so I want to be open and upfront with it right now.\\nYou are Tenno. The story starts out Tenno being awakened from Cryostasis by a mysterious figure known as \"Lotus\", you fight back the wave of enemies and secure a ship called the Orbiter where there\\'s a slightly unstable AI known as Ordis. Get used too these two voices because you\\'re going to hear them A LOT! From being on my ship and Ordis constantly asking whom I plan to kill and destroy next, to Lotus always scolding me whenever I get caught or an alarm has been raised on a mission. She could pretty much say \"So I guess you aren\\'t as good at stealth as you thought you were, huh Atratzu\".\\nThere are many different \"Warframes\", but they\\'re all connected to the same \"Tenno\". Each warframe looks slightly different, is highly customizable, Warframes have different powers, and some warframes appear male or female. Which inspired me to google \"Is Tenno Male or female\" and veteran players on forums seem to hate being asked that question so hopefully I\\'ve prevented some heated exchanges without butchering the explanation too much. Again: there really isn\\'t a gender for the Tenno, just different looking Warframes.\\nAs you go through the game there are a number of story progression and developments. You need to restore your ship, build crafting stations, active other stations. And then brace yourself for a huge time sink because after you unlock crafting you\\'re in for the farming spree of your life \\n. The game can be completely Free To Play and farm and grind your way to earn whatever you want to get. \\n Or you can use Platinum to speed up cool downs, or purchase upgrades or other Warframes. \\nAs far as the story is concerned, there\\'s a great deal of information and lore in the game, you can dig up even more by checking out codex entree\\'s on your ship on the various NPC\\'s, warframes, and much more. I\\'ve always found that the longer you work on a story the more satisfaction you get out of it.\\nThe controls for Warframe are quite straightforward, \"easy to learn, hard to master\", as people like to say about games like these. You can jump, double jump, sprint, roll, crouch, melee, shoot, change weapon, and use special abilities. There are also combo techniques for example, I frequently find myself sliding because I crouch and sprint all the time, so I often times find myself skidding on the ground off a ledge, and double jumping just in time to avoid falling off a ledge.\\nYou have many different weapon times, I found myself wielding a bow and Bo... HA, just realized I double Bo\\'d. But I also used Spira (kunai / throwing knives) side arms, and my most recently crafted weapon was the Grakata (machine gun). I typically try to play stealthy throughout a mission; thus my choice of weapons. But some missions you really can\\'t be stealthy on, and for those missions I wanted something with a higher rate of fire.\\nWarframe starts out very easily, so easy I completed missions without ever being detected. \\n However, the game gets complicated after you get closer to level 20-30 area\\'s the game starts to pick up in difficulty and I could no longer easily sneak through the game pinning my foes against the wall with my epic green arrows. The advent of moving out of \"early level / total noob status\", it became quite clear I had/have absolutely no idea what\\'s going on, and it\\'s going to take a great deal of research, reading, and explaining from friends who have played a lot of warframe, before I\\'m any good at it.\\nTake that as you will, the best suggestion I have is to watch some tutorial videos, or read up on some guides, there\\'s a lot that goes into this game and and the stats, gear, weapons, strategies, and tricks people use to get through the game. Sometimes the best strategy is to sneak through a level and pick people off with headshots, other-times you\\'re better off grabbing a noisy weapon, and gunning down a specific target you\\'re tasked to take down.\\nThere are many ways you can gauge your progression throughout Warframe. Your warframe and weapons have levels and upgrades that you can use on them. You also have \"Mastery Ranks\", and probably much more that I haven\\'t discovered yet. You can also take care of a pet, but you need to play actively to be able to get the resources to take care of your pet. Sadly I had to put my pet into stasis because I don\\'t play enough regularly.\\nI feel like I\\'ve only scratched the surface in this review, and I\\'ve already written a lot about game mechanics, the story, and controls. Ultimately the thing to take away from this review is \"Are you interested in this game? Has anything I mentioned in this review piqued your interest? If yes, download it and try it out for yourself, you\\'ve got almost nothing to lose.\"\\nI will add that I streamed some of the gameplay on my twitch channel and the warframe players I met over stream were quite friendly and didn\\'t insult me for not knowing anything about the game... and that\\'s pretty cool! Hopefully the majority of the community is like that, because that makes learning the game easier and less stressful.\\nIf I\\'ve missed anything really important in this review, or got something terribly wrong, feel free to comment with a correction!

       " \"Here are the good things about this game when you play Warframe.\\n1. You can become an ninja. In the game, you can literally be a ninja that can do sorts of things like fly in space which is known as an Archwing if you haven't known yet.\\n2. You can literally parkour. Just like Assassin's Creed, Warframe has recently added a new parkour system that can allow you to parkour through walls but not as that intense as Assassin's Creed.\\n3. You can have companions. - Seriously what kind of ninjas own pets. It's so cool that companions even have their own weapons and you can mod them to make them as powerful as your character or warframe. The only bad thing is that if you own a Kubrow they don't have weapons. Too sad for Kubrow owners. R.I.P.\\n4. The most awesome thing you can have is a freaking katana. The katana is called the Dragon Nikana and it's the ultimate weapon for a true ninja. The bad thing is you have to be at least Mastery Rank 8 to unlock it, get the blueprint, and use it. \\nSo far, this is all I can say about this awesome game called Warframe that can make you play as a ninja.\",\n",

If you do eventually find one then the next step is to grind away and build and collect untillyou can make yourself a little base to work off and maybe get a few dinos until someone comes along and destroys everything. Not because you were a threat, or because you had something they needed or because you attacked them, they destroy everything you have just because they can. one day you will log on and it will all be gone. so you start again, and again, and again, and again and eventually get tired of spending your life grinding and collecting and taming to only have it all destroyed and killed. Look just spend 5 Hours taming a dino. oh look they just killed it because they can. And their justification. If you dont like PvP play PvE and then deal with the fact that every server has bases taking up almost every inch of the map.\\nThen we start of the optimization issues.

       " \"I wanna get a few things off my chest in this review of Warframe, as someone who has been playing for over 550 hours, for those who are new to the game so they don't goof up as much as I did. First off, the game WILL take up space on your computer, so this isn't for the weak ones that crash easily either, and will also take up a portion of your time if you decide to play this.\\nSecond: this game is not something you can play for 8+ hours straight a day. Unless you have a clear objective of what it is you're gonna do when playing, be it alert missions that crop up with your desired rewards, missions, farming resources and prime items, etc. then you WILL get bored easily. I say this because of the hours I've wasted in indecision of what it is I wanted to do, and its just easier when you plan out what you want to work on.\\nThird: Be prepared to grind the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the missions when collecting resources or trying to rank up. You will not get far simply blitzing through each mission, and searching areas for much needed loot will help you later. Do not listen to those complaining about not getting enough loot when they go grinding, they make the mistake of speedrunning instead of being meticulous. That said, this leads me to my next point.\\nFourth: this IS a genuine F2P, and although real currency CAN (not WILL) be used, it is not necessary to advance at all. Using platinum (this is the currency you do exchange your real money into) is completely optional, and there are multiple tips I'll give on the use of it for newcomers: \\n1. Spending platinum is optional\\n2. don't use it on frivolous things like credits (the game's other currency that you can earn in any mission) or resources as it is NOT WORTH IT IN VALUE\\n3. save it for big purchases like colours, hard-to-obtain warframes or accessories. Trust me, you'll want to be stingy\\n4. There are ways of gaining plat WITHOUT spending real money, but it does involve grinding specific items and finding willing trading partners. These items are called 'Prime' items, and hold onto as many as possible - you do not want to be selling them for credits even if you cannot use them. Trade them as 'prime junk' with other items to gain platinum, just be patient when looking for partners. \\nFinally, Each warframe has a set of abilities connected to them that you can use. buttons 1-4 on your keyboard activate them during missions. It took me ages to realise they were even there, so I figured its best to tell you upfront to avoid my ignorance happening to you.\\nIts entirely up to you on how you play this, and yes there will be tech issues as addressed by other players, but otherwise its a fun way to spend a few hours of your day as well as be a paradise for hoarding and collecting. Or hell for the recovering ones, anyway. In short, good luck grinding the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game.\",\n",

The updates never bring ANYTHING new or significant.\\n-The lack of variety in gamemodes, there\\'s like 4 or 5 gamemodes and you better like them cause they are gonna be the only thing you play, ever.\\n-The PvP, this should have never been added, the Conclave is straight up dead, being horribly unbalanced and incredibly laggy, (I\\'ll get to the reason behind that next.) and Dark Sectors are controlled by clans that use DDoS and other shady tactics to force massive taxes down players throats.\\n-The lack of servers, every game is hosted by a player, which means lag, a LOT of lag, it sometimes makes the game literally unplayable, and it\\'s incredibly common.\\n-The crashing, I crash 2-3 times a day on Warframe, just... my god, if I had to list the amount of times I had to Alt-F4 out of the game, this review would be three times as long.\\n-The movement, you simply latch on to walls when you wall run, nothing feels natural, every jump, every vault, they all feel stilted and slow. Not to mention sometimes you just FLY mach 5 across the map when you jump from a sliding position, the jumps are so irregular.\\n-The melee combat, you run up to the enemy mash the E key and you MIGHT hit them, it\\'s completely random. And just like other weapons, melee weapons are completely unbalanced, for the most part heavy weapons are useless, and certain weapons destroy the rest hands down, its borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\\n-The Argon issue, every new weapon requires Argon crystals as an artificial way to make them harder to obtain, this simply comes from DEs issue of being uncreative with ways to acquire new weaponry.\\n-The fact that certain frames are one trick ponies, certain frames are only used for one (sometimes two) abilities, while the rest of their entire arsenal is completely ignored.\\n-The lack of a challenge, this somewhat correspondes with the game being too easy, with a certain frame and weapon, anything can be completed by a braindead child, people actually have to make up their own end-game of getting to high waves simply to have the RISK of being defeated.\\n-The lack of a skill requirement, as I said directly above, so long as you have the right weapon and frame, you can conqeur literally anything. There is no reward for being good at the game, in fact you don\\'t even have to try your best, simply having the numbers 1-2-3-4 on your keyboard is enough to be just as good as anyone else.\\n-The most ignorant developers I\\'ve ever seen, here is an example, there is a weapon called the Dark Dagger, it is awful, as every single handed dagger is. However, the hilarity insues when you realise, that the tiny Dark Dagger, is around the same speed as the giant two handed hammer Fragor. And you think that\\'s bad? NONE of the dagger stances actually match the Dark Daggers stance polarity, NONE. That is the most idiotic thing I\\'ve ever heard in my life to be honest.\\nIf you want to play with other people, join a clan, most of the community is elitism♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who don\\'t care about the gameplay, and are simply waiting for the next prime to come out.\\nThe more people who dislike this only proves what I\\'m talking about with the asskissing, every one of these points is true, no matter how much people will try to deny them.\\nFanboys will be ignored and most likely have their rant deleted, think before you post.',\n",

It can easily be said that it's dug into my subconscious and sucked me into the community and news more than any other game in my library, but just what makes it do so?\\nThe most mixed bag I've ever encountered. There are people that rip you off in trading, and leave one-wave survival fissures (I hate every single one of you, and so does anyone not you), but there's also people that start platinum (the game's big currency) charities for new players and actively try to make the community a better place. I have so many stories of both ends of the spectrum, but amazingly I've found that the good people in Warframe are unabashedly wonderful and outweigh the scum. From when I was an MR 1 noob to an MR 10~ still noob, there has always been a friendly face in a Relay or an encouraging word in Region chat to help. I've been carried so hard by friends old and new, and learned nearly everything through word of mouth, but I've never had a game bring that experience to me before.\\nAlso meme factor is unbelievable, I'd say the amount of goofing off through videos or inside jokes is on par with TF2 and I wouldn't even question it. If you like to goof off, both DE and the community will always have your back.\\nThe part everyone cares about. It can get grindy, it can get bs, it can get vague and unclear sometimes. All of these issues I've found to be remedied by getting/making friends to assist. Currently half the game is high-flying and fast-paced shootouts/brawls, and the other half is collecting/organizing mods and loadouts for either efficiency or humor factor. Any frame'r worth their salt will say the true endgame is Fashionframe, but I guess you could call helping new players and working the plat market to your favor the true endgames. DE still needs to figure out what balance is, but they're too loveable to stay mad at for long.\\nI am gonna say here and now that it takes a lot of work to impress me, and even more for me to genuinely like you. These complete nutcases and lunatics should not be left unattended or be allowed to run an MMO, but oh my good god have they won a spot in my heart for doing it anyways. Never seen a dev team so passionate, so hard-working, and full of so much character and personality as these loons. I love DE, even when they frustrate me and add universal vaccuum without telling me. These guys go with the flow, and embrace the juxtaposition of their game while simultaneously creating detailed and intriguing works of storytelling art, I do wish they didn't bury it in the later half of the game though. If you can get through the initial grind and fall into the rythm it demands of you, you will be rewarded with lore that will keep you up at night and asking questions.\\nIn summary, Warframe confuses me and we have a love-hate relationship but it'll never be uninstalled on any PC of mine.\",\n",

From the old Void and reward table system to this new relic one, I see a MASSIVE improvement in rewards and less reliability in off-site resources to be able to get what you're looking for. Not to mention improvements to trading and communication... Warframe really has tackled many of its issues and the developers don't seem to be afraid to rethink things and go outside the box. \\nGranted, I've only just recently gotten back into it, I'm still very impressed with how far it's come and how much has been added. I almost felt like a new player again upon my return, that's how much was changed yet all of the new additions were intuitive and by the end of it, I felt better about where the game is now compared to where it was when I stopped playing.\\nFor a game that's FREE and not pay-to-win, you really cannot go wrong.

Not only has its wide variety of missions, customization, endless weapon arsenal and increasingly-large warframe list, but also a fascinating lore that keeps growing. The coop element is crucial: nothing beats the experience of a full team of 4 space ninjas, each with their unique powers and weapons, wreaking havoc among hordes of unlucky enemies.\\nIt\\'s very easy to get started with Warframe, but it takes a lot of time and dedication to master all of it. Most of that dedication translates into farming. Farming of exp points, resources, credits, mods, blueprints, etc. Everytime you finally manage to craft that new weapon or warframe is so satisfying,... that\\'s when you get appreciate even the tedious part of the game. And even then, the game\\'s variety makes up for it. In my case, I have been playing it for 8 months straight, but I can see myself spending at least three times that amount of time in the future. That\\'s how hooked I got.\\nIn addition, after all this time, the game has accumulated a lot of story and lore elements that make it even more enjoyable to dive into. The introduction of the cinematic quests, starting with the celebrated \"The Second Dream\", created a campaign mode in which the solo play is excused, making you feel you\\'re playing the latest adventure of your favorite action saga. Plus these quests tend to unfold mindblowing revelations -the real nature of the warframes- and also new gameplay elements. And there´s nothing like playing them with your warframe wearing the latest fashion additions you managed to acquire after weeks of farming. Because looking fabulous is always important.\\nAlso this game looks pretty. No, that\\'s not quite it... GORGEOUS. There you go.\\nThere\\'s nothing much I can say about this game, other than it keeps growing, let\\'s hope for the better, and I\\'m sure it will deliver more epic experiences in the future.\\nWake up, tenno...',\n",

       " \"Great Game And it's Free! 8/10\\nThe multiplatform free-to-play game is an action shooter with some of the trappings of an MMO. It launched in 2013 and is available now on PC, PS4 and Xbox One, where it is regularly updated. As a recently-awoken space ninja called a Tenno, your job is to fly around the solar system doing space ninja stuff like assassinations, spying on people, stealing information, and performing sabotage. Each mission location and type remains the same, but the missions themselves are somewhat randomized. The game relies on a random tile system to keep things fresh. Your base of operations–and your main menu–is your ship.\\nWhen you log in, you’re sitting in front of your command console, which lets you select where you want to go in the solar system. To your right is the store. To your left is the codex. Behind you, deeper in the ship, are other stations, like the foundry that lets you build weapons or the armory that allows you to outfit and modify your frames.\\nAh, right, frames. The eponymous warframes operate like character classes, except instead of being locked into one class per character, you can swap frames at will, with each frame having four unique powers. For one mission, you might feel like running the supportive frame Trinity, who can mass heal the entire team or provide energy vampire abilities to ensure quick regeneration. On the next mission, you might want to play as Ember, whose incredible World on Fire ability burns every enemy within a massive radius.\\nYou obtain warframes by defeating bosses and getting their parts or by completing some of the game’s great quests. Warframes are not just some cool gimmick or branding idea, but a cool design choice. Two good ideas make them great: first, they’re all overpowered, and second, you have to hunt them down.\\nWarframe doesn’t care about balance. You’re a badass space ninja, after all! Rather than pushing players through a lengthy and meaningless grind, Warframe provides players tons of awesome and incredibly destructive powers. I love running Frost, a frame that launches a massive blast of ice, freezing everything around it, killing most low-level enemies. Playing like Frost feels like running around as a tactical nuke. The sheer destructive power being wielded is awe-inspiring, but that’s true of every frame. Valkyr’s power is invulnerability. It comes at the expense of ranged weapons, but that’s fine, because as a space ninja, your swords are just as cool, if not cooler, than your guns.\\nWhat’s great about being overpowered is that, since everyone is overpowered, no one is. The power you wield makes you feel like you’re actually a badass space ninja, because you’re killing lots of enemies quickly and efficiently. Other sci-fi games, like Mass Effect 2, force you into cover through a lack of health and a focus on small groups of enemies. There’s no sense of lethality or badassery going on when your character feels like they’re made of soggy toilet paper while enemies can last through an entire magazine of gunfire. Warframe understands this, so every frame feels fun to play, because every frame has powerful, over-the-top capabilities.\",\n",

       " '(I played this game over 1500 hours.. so maybe time to write a review?)\\nWARNING: This review might be on the long side but very informative, I\\'ll try to keep it short. (or read only the parts that might be usefull to you)\\nQ and A will be done at the end.\\n[NOTE English is not my main language so it might contain typo\\'s]\\nGametype:\\nThe game is a 3rd person action PvE shooter, but there is a small area for PvP.\\nThe maximum in PvE is 4 players in a game/match. PvP 4VS4 max.\\nThe game is a grind game what you need to like to keep playing. All \"warframes\" and weapons can be lvled to lvl30.\\nThere is also a player rank that only can be increased by the amount of weapons and warframes you have done.\\nScene:\\nThe genre and scene are placed in the future where you play a ninja kind of warrior called \"Tenno\". These warriors use the old ways of fighting with gun and blade. (rifles, shotguns, snipers, pistols, swords, hammers and way more)\\nYou\\'ll start out of a pod with no memory of your past. At that point you only know you got 1 enemy and those are the \"Grineer\". A massive clone army that are trying to get control over the solar system.\\nThis way you have to find, read and listen to any kind of piece you find todiscover what happend in the past with your fellow Tenno\\'s and yourself.\\nGameplay:\\nThe starting campaign is a nice introduction to get a bit known to the game. Varius gametypes are being shown at ya, some suit players better then others. This is a good thing to be with more.\\nAfter that the campaigns are not that well created and just to pull through and get the rewards. until far later in the solar system where there are suddenly a bunch of campaigns that give you a huge eyeopener.\\nNOTE: for this you\\'ll have to reach Uranus.. (yeah, ha ha... =.=\\' planet with the funny name to finally get some action.)\\nEvery Warframe and weapon acts different. Some Warframe got strong powers while others can survive longer under combat conditions.\\nTo navigate over the solar system you\\'ll need to play missions and unlock gates to go from planet to planet. these gates will stay unlocked ones opened. For each gate AKA \"junction\" you open you\\'ll get rewards, like new campaign and weapons.\\nThe starter weapons can be bought in the market of ingame \"credits\". Later weapons you can only buy weapon blueprints. These weapons need components to be build. This can take 12 till 24 hours, warframes might take longer sinse you have to build multible parts.\\nThere is also a payed value called \"platinum\". with this you can buy right away other weapons or warframes.\\nThen there is a last value called \"ducats\" but those can only be used at the trader ones every 2 weeks.\\nComponents can be found in every mission. Every planet got different components you need to build your gear.\\nA good tip is to pick up a much stuff that you\\'ll find lingering on the ground or in crates. This is only benefit for later projects.\\nWarframes and weapons can be changed in color to what you prefer. Some of them can be changed by style also. \\n[NOTE all cosmetics can only be bought with platinum. while ALL weapons and most frames can be grinded and be played. It might take longer and more time to get it, but it\\'s not impossible]\\nWarfame parts can be found defeating bosses. you might have to do it a few times but then you can get the blueprint of that warframe in the market.\\nWatch out how many times you defeat then though. It might attracted unwanted attention from those that hide in the shadows.\\nOnce you got a weapon or warframe you can mod it to make it even become better. Mods can be found through matchs by killing enemies or as rewards for particular missions. There are hunderds of mods to work with and those mods can be upgraded too!\\nCommunity:\\nThe community is really nice especially for those that get started. If you ask in your region chat for info there are most of the time at least 2 or 3 players to help you out.\\nAlthough there are also players that might complain about any of the updates (sometimes right, sometimes wrong. every game got those)\\nDevelopers and updates:\\nDevelopers will keep on their youtube channel and forums you up to date at least one or twise a month. On the youtube channel they also reward/highlight players and artists for anything they created based on the game.\\nUpdates are being added from time to time. These updates bring also bugs with it. The developers most of the time solve these issues within the day or within the week.\\nQ and A:\\nQ: can you be revived in a match? A: yes, once you lose your health you\\'ll lay on the ground for a while so other can revive ya. after that time you got 4 revive to respawn per match.\\nQ: platinum can i only get that by paying money? A: No, you can play a gamemode called void fissures. If you got a relic (what you\\'ll more of eventually) out of those relics come prime parts. These prime parts can be traded. search and ask for correct prices but you\\'ll be able to get platinum that way pretty fast. As long you sell the right parts for the right price.\\nI suggest to grind the parts and weapons you need. and keep platinum for all kind of cosmetics you want (example a nice color pallet so you can properly give you weapons and frames a nice style)\\nQ: Can you make clans? A: yes, clans can be created. these clan also get their own base called a \"dojo\". These dojo\\'s must be build up from scratch though and require a bunch of components to do so.\\nYou can expand your dojo, but that also means parts and research is going to cost more too. The reason all members should help to build it. you got 5 variants of clan sizes.\\nGhost: Max 10 players.\\nShadow: Max 30.\\nStorm: Max 100\\nMountain:  Max 300\\nMoon: max 1000\\nIn Dojo\\'s you can research and buy Blueprints of weapons you might not find in the market.\\nQ: ducats, how to get those? A: at a relay (a place all tenno can come together) you can trade prime parts also for ducats at 2 consoles. once every 2 weeks comes the trades at one of the 3 relays to show mods and other items that you cannot find anywhere else.\\nNote: not all relays are right away available. first relay is for player ranks (MR) 0+ the next is for MR 4+ and the last is for MR 8+.\\nQ: who are hiding in the shadows? A: It would be a shame to spoil that right? You need to find out yourself like anybody else did. :)\\nHope this gives enough information for the starters.\\nWhat I found pretty funny and yet showing how beginning players start :P',\n",
       " 'My review of Warframe\\nWarframe is an amazing game with a truly original story and setting.\\nIn the year 2029 Austria, birth place of Hitler, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Money Boy  and Joseph Fritzl decided to place a ban on all other forms of national production. Farms were closed, factories shut down and local stores were forced out of business. The only businesses allowed to operate were the ports, for importing food to feed the now practically enslaved workforce. All national production refocused on the construction of the \"Door Frame\" Austria\\'s answer to your door hanging needs.\\nBy the year 2031 rogue factions within the Austrian government decided it was time to strike, uploading a selective virus in to the entire nations production lines. This led to the creation of the \"War Frame\" a door frame so focused on war that it caused conflict wherever it was mounted, homes across the globe now featured Austrian doorframes and unfortunately a rogue batch of Warframes were also set loose across the globe.\\nThese Warframes were notorious, sealing front doors to homes to prevent you visiting your neighbours, sealing doorways to places of worship so people could no longer pray to their chosen gods and gradually over time the world fell to darkness and chaos, as even the doorways to power plants and gas stations refused to open.\\nSome Warframes gained sentience and self awareness and as they saw the human uprising finally coming to fruition, their evil colleagues and companions burned in the streets and smashed to splinters they rose up to assist their human allies in the fight against their own kind.\\nYou take the role of one of nineteen types of Warframe, from Oak, to pine to cedar wood. The choices are limitless, your skills totally customizable, from \\'tea tray services\\' to \\'Opening for the elderly\\'. As one of the newly freed warframes, you must take up the mantle of free-DOOR-m fighter, fighting across not only earth but the moon, Mars and Titan to free the oppressed human people from their true foes, the evil Warframes of the Austrian Mega-doorframe-corp.\\n11/10 would open and close door again.',\n",
       " 'You now that pleasant feeling when dopamine levels spike up in your prefrontal cortex and striatum? You know, that sense of reward and achievement? Well, Warframe is all about that - sense of illusory achievement in a virtual environment (which game isn\\'t?). Mostly, because you set up goals to get stuff and then you get it. To put it shortly Warframe = farming with guns. But it doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s bad.\\nIt\\'s actually very fun.\\nThere\\'s plenty of content. I have 200 hours on record and I still haven\\'t mastered all the gameplay elements and unlocking everything would take me another year or more (since the developers keep updating the game all the time).\\nDon\\'t be put off that it\\'s F2P, because you can get everything for free (except for skins and extra slots) - it just takes a lot of farming. Warframe is NOT P2W.\\nSo why is Warframe so fun?\\n- Ninja parkour: wall runs, slides, slide kills, bullet time, zipline kills, double jumps, ground slams...Warframe is a very fast-paced game and offers numerous ways how to kill with style.\\n- Unique abilities for different characters – choose your own \"pokemon\" and master it! Wreak havoc and assist your team!\\n-Friendly community - always someone around to help you out on a mission or trade with you.\\n- Clans - build your own dojo - vast customisation and research options – or join others to facilitate your progress through cooperation\\n- Tons of weapons, mods, sentinels/kubrows (pet or machine assistants) and warframes (suits) – most of the time you spend farming and upgrading stuff\\n- Your own ship - place where you build stuff\\n- Relays - places where you meet other players, trade for prime stuff, interact with syndicates (earning standing points unlock useful stuff)\\n- Archwing missions - Star Wars like shooting in the outer space!! (How cool is that?!)\\n- Quests - special missions with story and special rewards\\n- Various type of missions - plan your next step according to your desires or goals; there\\'s enough to choose from, so that you don\\'t feel bored\\n- Cool and challenging bosses - special reward drops and a bit of \"story\" that freshens up the farming experience\\n- Feeling of being a total badass hacking, slashing and shooting enemies across the Solar System\\nThere are some cons though, too:\\n- Paid content is too expensive without discount (I recommend to wait for random 75% discount on daily login rewards and to spend platinum on slots, orokin reactors/catalysts and formas (although you can build the latter three from rare BPs)\\n- Extra slots cost money (understandable) and there\\'s a certain pressure to purchase it, otherwise you can\\'t build a nice arsenal\\n- Farming is long (although it\\'s understandable, why would otherwise people would be motivated to buy something)\\n- Most other players rush out through the missions - which is kind of bad, if you want more time for looting\\n- Don\\'t like the Forma thing for polarity change - you reset your rank to zero and start all over again just to have extra space for mods\\n- Gamepad is not fully supported (some things don\\'t work)\\n- Solo is not possible for all missions - some are just too hard\\nAnyway, Warframe is a fun and addictive game. The best F2P game ever!\\nMy overall rating: 9/10',\n",
       " \"I often see reviews from people that have not had enough time in-game to truley judge it.  This review is from a very experienced (addicted) member of the warframe community, in-game, on the forums and the wikia.  \\nThis game consists of a unique combat style that allows for fluid change between melee and gunplay.  The enemies are currently a bit dumb, but as is the nature of this game, that may (as been mentioned by devs to most likely happen) change by further improving the pathing of enemies, and differenciating combat tactivs more between enemy type and faction.  The lore is currently hard to find, though based on community smarts, information attained from the codex (think pokemon with some added goodies) and the devoloper livestreams and posts.  The Lore is good, and there's enough room for speculation that allows for some interesting discussions/theorys.  The difference of experience between first playing, having a hold on the combat/movement along with having a decent arsenal, and then what is dubiously called 'end-game' is immense.  Starting off may feel slow, with the generic assualt rifle, pistol and long sword at your desposal.  Enemy factions are slowly introduced as you progress through planets, and bring a different style of play with them.  The grineer follow basic shooter patterns (aim for head, avoid hit scan weapons and some heavies), the corpus is more about reaction to shots than anticipation of them while keeping on your feet, as well as having a 90% resistance to damage taken to the head, or until you put a few rounds into their helmet and send it flying (so for once, the foot might be better than the face), and the infested, a pridominantly melee faction with pack mentality and zerg rush style tactics.  Once you progress, you begin to make your arsenal unique through mods (extra stat cards) that are dropped via RNG (Random Number Generater) when you defeat an enemy.  Weapons are not as important as getting mods to start off.  These mods allow you to take advantage of enemy resistances and status effects, as well as pure damage increase.  As you complete missions, real time alerts become available, which is a good way to get credits (basic currency) and items to improve your weapons, and skins and weapon that are either alert exclusive, or otherwise only obtainable from the market for plat (the games premium currency).  Mods affect your weapons ability and to some extent, the playstyle of that weapon, but there is also a large number of unique weapons (with more added almost every week) that will allow you a diverse arsenal of playstyles.  All weapons are attainable for free (throught the market under the blueprint section, or from farming other areas and bosses, or events).  At mid game, the fighting starts to pick up, and more avenues for play start becoming apparent.  At end-game, your mastery will have been substaintial increased (the psuedo overall player level based on number of weapons maxed), your arsenal will be full, you will have tried most of the warframes (classes), mods will not be a problem allowing min-max builds, and you will be focusing on farming Defence or Survival missions.  This, as the end-game gets a little tedious, and at times, unbearable if you can not find a good group o fplayers, or even a single mate.  Enemy level increase (damage dealt, able to soak up, and number of enemies) is really all the diffulcultty increase that there is.  New content is always being added, so the focus on what is end-game may very well change.  \\nOn a slightly different note, this game has its fair share of bugs (96% are no where near game breaking) and refining damage models, optimisation for more systems, and overall increase in stabilty are always being improved.  \\nAlthough this is advertised as a co-op, ninja game, co-operation is not a strong focus with the community.  lobby options such as solo, private (only friends can join) or invite only help with getting into the game at your own pace, or with a set group of friends you are chatting to.  Trailers depict a large amount of co-ordination of warframe abilities, but this in practice, is lesser.  A large portion of abilities are pure damage, with a few twist between playstyles, and the abilities that support the team mostly do not need another ability to contribute the most that it can.  Rushers are rampant in online public lobbies, and as there are end-game players only going into missions for a single purpose, they rush past everything else, which as a new player can be a bip, shall we say, disorientating.  The learning curve to be able to play this game is not steep, but the learning curve to master the game certainly is.  Each enemy has their own resistances and vulnerabilities, and modding for certain enemies can be the difference between life and death in this game.  All resistance info can be found in-game, but only after scanning enemy types for information int he codex.\\nIf that wall of text was too much to read, then I will sum things up easier before rounding this review off with my opinion.\\n Positive\\n- Uniqure combat style\\n- A plethora of weapons, and customization\\n- Warframes often feel unique, but familiar enough to learn to love\\n- Damage system offers a large amount of info to get sunk into, further increasing some peoples interest in the game mechanics, and devoloping weapon and warframe builds.\\n- Game is constantly being updated, with fixes to community voiced issues, gameplay performance, new weapons and warframes, as well as events, invasions and real time alerts.\\n- Everything that is not cosmetic, or convienience can be attained for free.\\n- Devolopers are part of our community,\\nNegatives\\n- Farming gets repetitive after a while unless you change play styles.\\n- With constant updates, it also brings new bugs.\\n- Your personal objective may be hindered by rushers, and their objective.\\n- End-game consist of two generic mission types to rank equipment.\\nIn summation, my personal feelings about this game are tilted towards loving it (when its not throwing a devoloper induced fit) and plenty of patience.  The experience is enjoyable, and there is a lot to go in-depth based on lore or gameplay mechanics.  The devolopers are always answering questions, and taking feed back.  Yes I have put money into this game, but only the equivalent of a low budget disc game.  I highly recommend giving this game a try for at least 15 hours before making a final decision.  Get to know regular players, and the farming can be easily broken up with informal conversation, which I consider great, as the tenno are a family.  I have maxed almost every item in the game, ahve all available mods, and till have an erge to check in every day to see what smal, large, or passive things have changed.  Try this game, and you will never feel the same about any other game after.\",\n",

Once you get into it, you won't come out, easily anyways. \\nThe community is also pretty non-toxic. Since trading items is a colossal part of warframe, everyone's pretty darn polite (which I think really is being polite to your money, but we might as well ignore that, eh?), and it feels good. \\nBut what I REALLY like about Warframe is that you can access the paid DLC content for FREE, (which is not just in game currency) if you grind hard enough, and that is something I haven't seen in other games.\\nThere you go, my opinions.

Modding allows you to constantly decide what upgrade you want to add to your weapon or warframe on every level-up. This can either make your weapon best stronger versus a certain faction, very fun to play with, or, very simple and sometimes very weak. It can take a while to find the best mods for weapons but when you get them the whole experience changes for the better! What more could you want?

The actual gameplay isn\\'t even bad.\\nBut the game is flawed.\\n1) Welcome to grindland.\\nIt\\'s basicaly a huuuuge grind. Everything can be either bought with money or grinded, but buying in-game items with real cash is out of the question because of the ridiculously high \"platinum\" prices.\\nBut hey, who wants to pay to get stuff anyway right? Go out there and farm that orokin golden bling bling gear, mighty space ninja!\\nAs much as  I like the fact this is a TRUE free to play, I just can\\'t stand game where the sole sense of achievement you get from playing it is about your possessions. In fact, the entire rank of your account is based on how many different weapons you own. Doesn\\'t that give you a slight hint on how much of a grinding simulator this is?\\n2) \"Balance? what is that lawlzors\"\\nI started playing at update 8. That was almost 3 years ago. \\nAt times, some weapons were already better than others, but not by that much (eg. Boltor). You could run any set of gear and still enjoy all the different playstyles they provide. but as the game progressed over the years, it was crippled by some MAJOR powercreeping. To this day, those weapons I played with at update 8 are completely useless. Some of them had slight buffs, but are still absolute trash (see Lanka for instance). Basicaly all the \"top gear\" that all those high level players use are either  a new weapon that\\'s blatantly overpowered (Just think of the Soma when it came out) or a prime variant of it, which is basicaly a better, shinier version of a gun, that sometimes is already too strong, because the devs have zero knowledge in how to balance the game (Soma prime?! What a good idea!).\\nWhat this means is that to run harder missions, the best choice of gear will always be that one new weapon that\\'s just stronger than the rest, not that cool polearm you loved so much, simply because it\\'s being outclassed by that one new melee weapon that just came out, or whatever else is considered the best weapon at times. This restricts a ton of different playstyles from being anything near viable. Want to play a Sniper zephyr with glaive with the Vectis\\'s unique playstyle? Well sorry, but the glaive is old, thus underpowered, and a new sniper just came out which is better than the vectis by a long shot. Yeah, I had that happen to me.\\nIt\\'s just a race to aquire the strongest weapons, which are then replaced when a new patch brings out something better. Meanwhile older but sometimes more fun gear are left in the closet accumulating dust due to their innefectiveness. Playstyle diversity is a joke is this game. Even the many different classes have only one, 2 rarely, viable build for the late game.\\n-=Conclusion=-\\nThe reason why I can\\'t recommend this game is probably because I grew up, and started to dislike games centered about grinding and possessions. Yeah, Warframe\\'s gameplay is good, but you\\'ll never jump into a mission telling yourself \"I\\'m here to have a nice game\" , but instead thinking \"I\\'m here to get X item\". Some of my friends enjoy these types of game, so if that\\'s your thing, go ahead and jump in.

       " \"This game hs the potiental but devs are to concerntrated in trying push new content instead of fixing the current problems that have.\\nThe community is far to toxic, its not just the chinese and russians but they play a huge part in the toxicity of the PvP servers. \\nUnfortunately not much can be done on that unless regionlocking which would screw the game further. They've made it far to easy for the mega tribes to greif servers constantly and persisting to do so weeks on end and the only thing you can do is have a constant watch on the server and get up at times when your server is quietest. \\nSmall tribes or even medium tribes dont stand a chance as they can transfer from server to server which high quality gear,  dino's, rafts and turrets and merely mess with the server for hours on end. Dev's have once again screwed up massively. The game has to be a full time commitment or not point playing.\\nThis being said there is good points to the game dont get me wrong, there are ways around the constant grinding and hardwork. Personally i play offical as its more sense of an acheivement but also means every single loss of item, gear or dino hurts that little more.\\nYou can have fun and there are multiple offical servers which arent full of those bigger tribes who raid you for no reason other then the fact that they're either scared or arent big enough to do proper raiding. \\nAll in all this game is good, has alot to work and should be worked on instead of releasing more  new stuff.\",\n",

The game has good features but the devs insist to follow other developers in making another grind fest so that only larger groups (tribes) can achieve any content. This was their worst nerf bat by far that has made this one of worst grinding games. \\nNow for ranting\\n* Devs keep turning game into another endless grind game. Anything we discover to increase production so tribe can move into content of game, they listen to a few whiners and nerf bat to increase the grind.\\n* Happy you got an mastercraft or ascendant blueprint for that sword? It only took you months of grinding, taming, breeding and leveling to get it out of that snow cave or water cave that you just lost your mossa to. Now go grind 1,400 metal and craft all that metal into a light weight sword. Cause 1,400 lbs  of metal will only weight 5 lbs when you pound it on the smithy. Now that you took all that time to gind mats to craft your sword. Watch the devs toss in more and more dinos that will steal your sword. Shock you to death where you can\\'t swing sword to defend. Knock you off flyer to your death.  But hey.. you did get to hold that sword for 10 minutes!  They\\'ll have 5 new dinos next week to make you lose your gear in more ways. And don\\'t forget! Next week they\\'ll nerf your grinding again so you appreciate those 10 minutes of holding sword even more!  .... \\n* \"Duke Nukem Forever\" has nothing on how long this game will be \\'Beta\\'\\n* \"OMG we added something that turned out benificial to players!

       " 'I have played over 1300+ hours on Ark Survival Evolved.\\nAfter experiencing in full what the game has to offer.\\nI am very happy to see that the VAST MAJORITY who\\'s played Ark are united on the same page and feel the same way about this game.\\nThat general consensus being that this game had great potential but the developers has done nothing to help it\\'s community in achieving what it\\'s player base wanted.\\nArk is fun in some ways. However, it is THE MOST TIME CONSUMING game you will ever play. This is due to the system of the game which offers no balance to new players or fresh players that have just come to a new server. The aim of the game has become to oppress the newcomers and to never trust a single outsider, sometimes even the members of your own tribe who may seek to overthrow you.\\nAs the leader of an official server, despite having achieved all I needed to achieve to be at the top, I soon realised it was taking me 3-4 hours of daily maintenance in order to ensure my base was up to date and secure. To spend that much time just to be on a game NOT TO PLAY, but to complete \"Chores\" in order to survive in a game before being able to play in it is much too ridiculous if I may say so.\\nThe bugs and glitches are many and yet the devs continue to implement and add new things and creatures to the game without improving the gameplay or optimization one bit.\\nEXAMPLES INDLUDE: You can easily get stuck in rocks and die of a glitch anytime. You can sit down on a chair you made and try to fish and suddenly you die due to some completely unexpected glitch is just fkn unacceptable.\\nWith all of this being said, there are still quite a few things that aren\\'t quite right with Ark. Whilst many of us have supported Ark\\'s Developers and invested much of our hard earned money in hopes of seeing this game come to fruition. None of this has come true for us. To add a final bitter aftertaste for all of us loyal supporters who helped support this game for years, we are then forced to an Ultimatum to either purchase the game for the full price or not be able to play this game even after paying $30 USD for a poor Early Access which required financial aid from a then non-existent player base.\\nHaving given a piece of mind, I bid this game farewell. AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE.\\nJUST PLAY A BETTER GAME AND SUPPORT BETTER DEVELOPERS.\\nHave a good one. Thanks for reading.\\nP.S - Thank you to the Ark Developers who created something that had some great features in it and for enabling me to make some great moments and memories through the game. Sorry I am unable to support you any longer. Good bye.',\n",
       " 'There are simply some games that I cannot write a proper review for due to a lack of space, so Ill try to be breif, keep in mind, theres no \"Yes and no\" recommendation, I chose negative because people wanting to see the reasons to avoid the game may gain more from my review, I recommend the game for some and not for others, as seen at the bottom. \\nArk is a game that should be considered a dream. The concept is something every child dreamed of, a world of riding dinosaurs, having them as pets, exploring? What kid didnt wish for that at some point??\\nThe issue is the direction Ark is being developed in. Heres the scoop. The game devs play much more to the massive clans of gamers who have all day to play and keep bases, this is understandable since most of those players are wholly devoted to the game, get more gamers on to join their clan, etc.\\nSo to put it in perspective, the games progression goes Cavemen gear>Cowboy gear>futuristic assault gear and bases of metal with generators and such. You can probably see the issue with this, is that theres a massive leap, and to compound it, most content is endgame content. \\nThis means a simple thing, you and your buddy, 2 people, are wholly, and totally, dead. You will never, ever make it past the age of basic firearms. In Vanilla gameplay, it will take you literal weeks of constant work to get anywhere IF You are never snuffed out along the way, this game is designed for massive clans of 20+ people who can play most of the day (Same issue rust has, the only people who get anywhere dont have lives and never leave the computer, therefore never can be offline raided, see?) \\nAs if it wasnt already a bit one sided, they plan on adding MORE endgame content for the bigger clans to chase. the \"Teck\" age of plasma weapons and dinos with plasma cannons on them. \\nThe hugely linear progression with its massive jumps make this game a huge chore to play even in private PVE servers (The only place small groups can play). The fact the devs are adding even more to endgame shows a clear bias toward the big clans that everyone despises for ruling servers. \\nIn addition to this, the game itself is out to get solo or small group players. The way dino\\'s level makes it so you dont know if a dino is going to take 1 shot or 15 shots of your rifle. The levelling system is extremely overdone and defeats immersion by making it feel like playing borderlands with a level 50 friend when you are level 1 (Hint: Your guns do nothing). Thats not even all though! And as a final nail in the solo coffin, you cant learn all the blueprints with one character and that character only unlocks them with level, so you and your little group better plan out in precision who learns what. \\nNow, while so far ive been hard on the game, I reiterate my point that this is a dream game. In a private server with settings designed to make the game a less-hellish experience for small groups, it is super fun! No big clans to kill you, increased rescources and survivability, and suddenly you have a fantastic PVE game that lets you live out some of the fantasies you had as a kid. \\nAll other points are listed below.\\nPROS \\n-Fantastic concept\\n-Incredible array of dinos that can be tamed and used for their own talents (They add dinos in so much that its almost worth complaining that they dont devote that time to other things)\\n-Under proper circumstances for small groups, its a fantastic survival exploring game\\n-For massive clans, its the be all end all in fantastic PVP\\n-Very active dev-team that do seem to honestly care about the game, they are great people.\\n-Very customizeable servers allow you to bypass many of the negatives shown and have fun by doing things like increasing player health and whatnot. \\nCONS\\n-Almost impossible for small groups or solo guys to survive on anything but PVE, private servers or heavily modified unofficial PVP servers. \\n-Huge amount of bugs and crashes, Dinos dont even have pathfinding and cant see obstacles, will happily walk into a wall for an hour, and have gotten stuck in trees since the game first came out and still do. \\n-Easily the worst optomized game ive ever played, 3 minutes to load for me with a SSD (Some people report 45 second load times, I dont doubt this is possible with a top of the line rig (Mine is no potato, custom made and upgraded just months ago) \\n-too little focus on early game content, too much focus on late game content, stated this trend will continue with the \"Teck Tier\" \\n-Released DLC with items that should have been in the base game during early access (Boomerang, Whip, flamethrower, etc, desert armor, etc) \\n-Worst building system of any survival game ive ever played, spend 3 hours to create a tiny base just because of how expensive parts are, the running back and forth because of encumberment, and the finnicky behavior of the system. \\n-Admins are extremely tied in terms of what they can do, the fly command moves you at a snails pace, you cant build or create things without first spawning them, then you have to keep your weight limit in mind as it still applies in god mode and fly mode (Essentially no creative mode)\\n-Many items are nerfed to the point of being useless. Grapple hooks are awesome, but useless that they can only be used once, same with bolas. Sleeping gas doesnt work on dinos, Sleeping gas traps cant be used to help tame dinos, tons of silly rules that just make the creative choices one could make disappear. \\n-Stealth system is next to nonexistant, which is strange in a game where you will spend hours trying to hide from large dinos.\\nRECOMMENDATION\\nIts simple, if you have a top of the line computer and a massive clan and tons of time to give to this game, you should buy it, full price, it is entirely worth it on every level\\nIf you do not have a top of the line computer, DO NOT BUY IT, NO, IT WILL NOT RUN ON YOUR LAPTOP! EVER! I have seen so many people complain on the forums that the game wont run on potato# 221, this has been made clear and YOU are responsible if you buy it for a rig that cant play it!\\nFor people who CAN run it and have small groups or solo, I would hold off until the game is more balanced and fixed up. It can still be a ton of fun, thats not in doubt in any aspect, and the larger the group you have, the more worth it the game will be. For most, this is a game you will want to hold off on until its more complete.\\nSUGGESTIONS\\n-Give a better set of instructions on the \"Sliders\" given when creating a server, no one guesses that setting player resistance to a lower number would make them stronger ingame (Which is exactly how the slider works) \\n-Expand on other epochs and styles besides primitive and superpowered. Give us some stuff in the middle, maybe some things from the age of exploration. Elephant guns for hunters, compound crossbows for the stealthy assassins.\\n-Increase the usefulness of items that arent used much, grappling hooks would be much more common and helpful if they didnt last one shot only, the sleeping gas weapons are a tamers dream, but dont work on dinos, etc. \\n-Return vehicles to the game, and give them to all epochs. Ill happily take a pedal powered vehicle made of vines and Macgyver sweat during early game, helicopters late game, that kinda thing, let there be a choice between dinos and vehicles as they each have merits (And some of us truly do miss the buggy that was removed)\\n-The taming and breeding times for some dinos is entirely insane, (I am talking 9 or more hours of continuous attention under some circumstances, and for breeding and growing a baby, sometimes days)\\n-EDIT FOR TECK\\nI dont need to say much on the new teck tier trailer, it speaks for itself. Are the toys amazing? Yes, does 90% of the trailer show those toys getting used on people who have no chance of survivng an assault by them? Also yes, take that as you will.',\n",

       " \"I enjoy ARK it's a great concept, looks beautiful (if you have a top of the line card to run it) and the interaction with other people on all servers is great. However, this paid DLC release has me rather upset as just the day before it's release I launched ark started a singleplayer game and walked 3 feet to find a brontosaurus have lodged into a rock and unable to be interacted with.\\nFor those of you saying that we shouldn't be complaining about paid DLC, this game is unfinished and they released DLC for an unfinished game.\\nThis is comparable to let us say I bought a car from toyota I paid them up front expecting to build me a car, they sold me on all the features power windows locks heated seats etc. Now my car is kind of finished it has seats but they aren't heated and I have windows but I have to crank them myself. Toyota now decides to releasea new car, my car, but with a different paint job and tells me that if I want this car I have to pay them the same amount as the original unfinished car but I can only have this car if I've bought the first car too.\\nThis is bad business practice, no matter how you look at it.\\nI love playing this game it's great I would like it more without all the bugs. I'm okay with more delays of release date to fix said issues but not if the delays are due to them painting another car to try and sell me without the proper amount of people to work on the original product promised.\\nWhile I want to recommend this game I cannot recommend the company same as I would for Electronic Arts a game backed by an untrustworthy company is not a game that I would tell others to play. Hopefully Wild Card can figure this out and turn something around to persuade much of the community into appreciating them and this game again.\\nEDIT: To add to this argument of you got your $20 worth of time out of the game. This is invalid for the main reason of imagine buying a hot dog and getting 3/4 of said hot dog eating it and being kind of full but still wanting the other quarter. An unfinished undelivered hot dog still leaves me hungry and wanting the last 1/4 of my hot dog.\",\n",
       " \"With over a hundred hours under my belt, I'd say I'm sufficiently versed in ARK to write a review of my own, as redundant as it may be.\\nBefore I begin, I am posting a disclaimer: ARK, at it's core gameplay mechanics, is a fun game. I've played more of ARK than I ever have of the Stomping Lands. But like the Stomping Lands or any other survival game, it's not the game that's the problem, it's the people.\\nAND THIS REVIEW ONLY APPLIES TO PVP SERVERS, MOSTLY OFFICIAL.\\nMy time in official servers are indeed limited. But the mix of what I have seen and reports from my friends and other Ark players tell me that Official servers are bad. One of the moderators has apparently even called them cesspools. Unofficials aren't immune to griefing, but you'll be better off in them.\\nARK: Survival Evolved is a different take on what we wanted since the Stomping Lands. Surviving against dinosaurs and teaming up with friends to harness the awesome strength of these animals and build amazing forts. Sadly, what we have right now is a grief fest with dinosaurs in the background.\\nIt IS the Stomping Lands. Sure, it's prettier, it's got more species and structures and blah blah blah. But I see dinosaurs wandering around aimlessly in ridiculous numbers with no proper herding behavior, angry predators that can chase you forever and kill everything in their path until they die, and people just KoSing and destroying everything in sight. There is little, in its current stages, setting this apart from the Stomping Lands. But there is tons of potential here and the devs can easily move ARK away from its deceased predecessor.\\nAs it stands, ARK's gameplay is like the Stomping Lands in that you're probably going to log on to your stuff being destroyed. The only way to prevent that is to get amazing defences as quickly as you can. I did that once, tamed a bronto before I was even half way to getting the saddle. He became obsolete after Tyrannosaurs were powered up, and a Tyrannosaur that was lower level than him killed him before that patch anyway. I now have my own Tyrannosaur, and my tribe has only been raided one time since we got him...and by raided I mean the people attempted to raid us but our Tyrannosaur ate them all.\\nBefore all the 'hardcore' PvP lovers come yelling at me and calling me a carebear and that I should go to PvE, let me make one thing clear. I don't mind PvP, PvP can be fun, but not as it is now. Let me explain better for those of you who do not have the game yet.\\nLike Rust, which I have not played, ARK uses a 'sleeper' mechanic. You log off, your unconcious body remains in the world for others to do with as they please. If you've worked hard, hopefully you have a decent wall and a few loyal dinosaurs between your loot and any looters. However, the tamed dino AI is somewhat lackluster, as are the sensory ranges of some of the animals over all. And the balancing is even worse.\\nThis game suffers from a bad case of PvO. Player versus Offline. Essentially, you log off, cowardly raiders ride in on their dinosaurs, kill your dinosaurs since your dinosaurs don't attack as fast as mounted ones do, and then proceed to steamroll your base into the dirt, taking all your hard earned goodies with them. The raiders who attacked our base were PvOers. None of my tribe was online. It was only because of our Tyrannosaurus that our stuff is in tact. This sort of stuff will likely be the only combat you ever see, or rather never see. That, or KOSing by fresh spawns or griefing trolls. I was knocked unconcious for a handful of berries and stone pickaxe once. No joke.\\nAs it stands, there is no viable way to defend your base. There are turrets, but you must constantly resupply them with fuel and ammunition. Your dinos are probably going to do jack diddly squat, because someone is always going to have a dinosaur that is stronger than yours, and probably more of them. I can't list the number of animals I've tamed or began taming, only for them to be killed by someone 'fer de lolz'.\\nIf you buy this game as it is now, you will only be met with your work being destroyed, a multitude of times. I play on an unofficial server, and these are apparently better, especially ones where the admins and owners are active, vocal, and friendly. But you WILL lose your work, and you will most likely be offline when it happens.\\nI want to recommend ARK, I do. If you can get your friends together it can be good fun, fleeing from hungry carnotaurs, or doing battle with a tyrannosaurus, but the fact of the matter is that you will encounter cowards who will destroy your work time and again because they're bored or get some sick pleasure out of it. Until the developers can find some cure to the PvO issue, I really just can't say you should buy it right now. You WILL waste your time rebuilding.\\nWill I keep playing it? Most certainly, but the fact of the matter is that the PvO is starting to take its toll in other ways and it's not good. Ruins are being left like confetti on New Years' Eve in Time Square. The coast is littered with abandoned huts and bases, all broken into by griefers or raiders. And likely, the owners were offline when it happened.\\nAs soon as a cure to this ailment is found, I shall change my review. Until then, I just have to say no to buying it, for sake of your time and money. You WILL invest hundreds of hours into this game, I can tell you that. But most of that time should not be spent building back what you had because you actually had to go to sleep, or work, or go to school.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'ve played this grindfest since it had Founder\\'s packs. I\\'ll admit back then I wanted to purchase, wanted to have Founders, but did not trust the game to continue onward to the place it has gotten to. I used to play it a lot, even more than STEAM shows because I had it downloaded before it was added to STEAM. I got up there in Mastery Ranks. I was around when they added the Clans and Dojos (right after Runescape had a similar update coincidence?) I was around when they added the Syndicates. All of that was fantastic, but never left me with the same impression as the Void. I remember very well when the Void was added, and how much of a blast I had in all of those missions.\\nRecent updates have moved away from the void and towards a new method of farming for \"Prime\" loots that feels even grindier than before. Get the Relic, upgrade the relic, go do a normal mission with a fissure open, all missions to find Prime parts are now essentially Executions. Gone are the days where you could sit in a Defense and go 40+ waves for Prime parts. Gone are the days where the Void even matters. Now it\\'s a normal map you can visit to farm for Argon Crystal you\\'ll rarely need. A whole group of tiles, completely useless now. \\nRecent \"Reworks\" have left some Warframes feeling abused and left limp and ragged. Take Trinity for example. THE Medi-Mom frame that heals everything and keeps your squad in enough Energy to spam your stupid kill-frame ability as much as possible. They took a Warframe with the only decent healing ability in the game for about 2-3 years, then nerfed her healing power into the dirt. When that happened I saw numerous people try and use Oberon as a healer. His healing ability has been broken since he was released, but they\\'ll \"rework\" perfectly good frames. \"Rework\" being code for \"nerf\".\\nI don\\'t even know how to go about the community on this game. Half the trade chat will try and scam you for premium currency, the other half will try and scam you for the item at a lower cost than it is \"worth. Half the game is people rushing through an objective, leaving you in the dust to try and figure out the map if you haven\\'t. Getting left behind to wait for elevators, having scrubs set off alarms during Spy missions. Or you go to the Forums for Digital Extreme\\'s \"Contests\" that are the biggest shitfests ever. No one can follow rules, not even the DE staffers who run the garbage contests.\\nTL;DR I used to love this game, but the staff and community have turned it into a heaping♥♥♥♥♥♥pile that I\\'ll probably never play again.',\n",
       " 'An extremely well polished, sleek, sexy third person shooter/hack-n-slash where you take control of a space ninja.\\nWarframe will see you rise from your slumber, at the behest of some broad wearing an impractical visor, who will promptly start telling you what to do, where to go, and how to do it. She will provide such riveting input as \"It\\'s the Grineer!\" and \"Doors sealed.\" and who could forget the classic: \"Why do you spend so much time playing that game?\". From there, you galavant around the solar system slaughtering thousands and doing physically impossible things like:\\n- Operating around Mercury, a planet so close to the sun the average temperature is about 400 degrees.\\n- Traversing a plane of existence populated only by mind-controlled techno-zombies.\\n- Getting the last piece of Rhino Prime.\\nWarframe likes to build itself up as a complex and lore-rich game filled with boatloads of content and a tight combat system.\\nUnfortunately, what it actually is is a more technologically sophisticated version of Farming Simulator. You want that fabulous looking gun from the market? Well get your wallet out because this game will suck you dry like a vampiric ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you don\\'t like spending extortionate amounts of disposable income on a FREE TO PLAY GAME, then tighten your belt, grab your pillow and get ready to play the captivating, soul-crushing experience that is Warframe.\\nThe game\\'s general gameplay is a fun blend of shooting and slashing. Your character carries both ranged and melee weapons, as well as using a set of abilities that come with whichever \"Warframe\"(Class) you choose. These weapons can range from pistols, to rocket launchers, to flamethrowers, to a gun that literally shoots rubix cubes. The variety of these weapons is a major selling point of the game. As it stands right now, there are dozens of weapons to choose from, as well as a great deal of \"classes\", most of which are well thought out and interesting. Some of which make you question the whole \"space ninja\" ideal (really? A water frame?).\\nWhen you first get into Warframe, you\\'ll see all this content, the lovely graphics, the polished sound design and fluid combat and think \"All of this is free to play?! Hot damn that\\'s amazing!\".\\nSadly, this is what most people think before they begin to understand DE\\'s business model.\\nWarframe is a game about grinding. You perform the same missions ad nauseum for the sole purpose of levelling up your weapons/classes, and gathering materials that have a mercilessly low drop rate. If you\\'ve played World of Warcraft, you know the feeling of running the same boss again and again and having it not drop what you want. That concept is applied to this entire game. You will grind. Forever. I\\'ve played for over 850 hours and I only just got every warframe and about 80% of the weapons.\\nIt\\'s a structure of loot-tables and abysmal drop rates designed to stretch the game\\'s overall playing time to the longest possible length. It teases the player with what they could accomplish, and then forces them to spend entire days playing for a single item, only to hit them with hurdle after hurdle. \\nYou want to get a new Warframe (class)?\\nHere\\'s what you need to do:\\n- Play the game until you unlock the planet\\'s final boss.\\n- Grind the boss, many of which feature invincibility phases and can take up to 5 minutes to kill each time even with a full team of players.\\n- Pray to whatever gods you believe in that 1 of 3 \"parts\" drop.\\n- Run the boss again and again for the other 2.\\n- Build each \\'part\\' of the frame, each of which costs even more resources, credits, and literally 12 hours of real-world time.\\n- Buy the \\'blueprint\\' from the marketplace, which is often extremely costly for newer players.\\n- Use your parts to fashion the final Warframe, which will take, and I\\'m not kidding, THREE DAYS TO BUILD.\\nRemember raid lock-outs from WoW? That concept where if you kill a boss you have to wait a whole week until you can kill it again? The same thing exists in this game, but in a different form. You will spend most of your time in Warframe waiting for things to happen. You will wait for weapons/warframes to build. You will wait for the (entirely randomised) alerts to pop up with something good. You will wait for something interesting to happen. It\\'s like if someone made Stormwind into a full game.\\nEvery now and then, the developers will throw out an event, these are usually half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ completely rigged against the player, extremely poorly thought-out, rampant with bugs, and a massive waste of time. But they\\'ll make you feel forced to play the terrible content by granting players that force themelves to endure it a big shiny one-of-a-kind weapon. And it often isn\\'t worth the trouble.\\nThe story isn\\'t much to write home about. You wake up from stasis and find yourself in the middle of a warzone between clones, zombies and jews. From there you stab and slash your way to victory. Victory isn\\'t actually in the game yet though, so you might want to set your sights a bit lower first. Maybe try getting Volt Prime, I dunno.\\nWarframe is a good game. I would even say a great game. It\\'s just dragged down by developers that don\\'t understand how to balance or handle the game they\\'ve created. It\\'s a restrictive, neutured experience which constantly keeps players on the edge. A nefarious business model based entirely around the carrot-on-a-stick method.\\nIf you don\\'t mind grinding, if you have friends that already play this, if you don\\'t mind developers consistently wrecking the game every patch and if you have a great deal of podcasts you need to catch up on, then I would recommend Warframe.\\nIf you want a game that will grant progression based on how much time and effort you put into it, then I would not. The game will slam you with real-life time restraints and force you to wait days for content you already spent weeks grinding for. It\\'s a time-sink in every sense of the term, and it\\'s not enjoyable in that respect. \\nA good game hindered by greedy developers and the micro-transaction business model designed to keep players playing for as long as possible.\\nBut hey, at least Nova has a nice♥♥♥♥♥\\n5/10.',\n",

This game is extremely grindy, but I certainly don't mind, because the core gameplay is solid and enjoyable (albeit with a few snags here and there). There are warframes to suit darn near every playstyle out there, and the 3 frames you get to choose from at the beginning reflect this well. Most importantly.. EVERY warframe and EVERY weapon can be acquired without spending a cent. This is where the grinding comes in. You have to have patience, and play the game. Of course, if you don't have patience, you can always just buy some platinum, and spend that on warframes, weapons, and various cosmetic goodies instead!\",\n",

       " \"The Community:\\n     It isn't cancer. Everyone is friendly, even the veterans who are maxed ranks always are helpful. You will occasionally get a guy who just acts like he's better than everyone else and noone can climb his ego, but you get that anywhere. 9/10 for the community rating.\\nThe Gameplay:\\n     Excellent mix of gunplay, melee combat, ability combat, and companion mechanics! Being able to slide around and jump 50 meters in the air, while shooting an enemy, slamming a giant axe down on another, then unleashing your ultimate on a group in front of you is just always satisfying. There is a variety of missions, weapons, Frames (basically characters), and items to keep you entertained for a long time, and although it does either take a TON of work and time to get these (this can also be bypassed completely by purchasing Platinum, one of the two in-game currencies), it still will keep you feeling acomplished and wanting more. There is also so many combinations/varieties of ways you can mod your weapons, frames, and even companions, to get some awesome buffs and an overall edge in combat. The combat mechanics gets a 10/10 because they literally give you so many combat options, and it is sooo much more polished than what it used to be a few years back.\\nFree to Play? So it's Pay to Win right?:\\n     The game is mainly a co-op game, and there really isn't a competitive aspect to it, so I wouldn't necessarily call it Pay to Win, I'd call it Pay to Skip weeks of hard work and frustration. It is 100% possible to obtain every single item in the game (minus exclusive frames/Items that aren't obtainable anymore, but may be at some point) without shelling out a pennie, but you would be talking months, maybe even a year to complete and catch up with the updates, which they are always adding new stuff to keep it fresh. You are able to obtain Platinum by completing missions and objectives to obtain Prime items (an upgraded version of a weapon/frame) and then sell them to other players in the trading channel for platinum. You could even merch off items if you had the time and bought the right items cheap and sell them for more. All in all, it's not a pay to win game and if you wanted to buy platinum, all you would be doing is supporting the development of the game and thanking them, in a way.\\nNegatives/Complaints:\\n     -The modding system, crafting system, navigation, and sydicate system is criminally underexplained. They need to make it more friendly to new players and make a quest of some sort that has them upgrade a mod to complete a mission in some way and write a lot of dialogue for Ortis to explain how this system works, because I found myself reading the wiki, watching videos, and asking others how these things worked.\\n     -If you are someone who doesn't have a whole lot of time on their hands, you won't really be able to progress much in this game, because it takes a buttload of hard work and time to progress, without spending money on platinum. This game is all about the GRIND. If you don't have time, it will take you even longer to progress in this game.\\n     -At times, the missions become more and more repetitive and it starts to kill your motivation. They are at work at trying to improve these problems and I have faith that it can be done, with time.\\nIn conclusion, I would rate the game 8/10. It has those 10/10 moments all the time though, so its a very full cup sitting at 8/10. Thanks for spending the time to read this review\\nEDIT: Even more amazing with the Plains of Eidolon Update\",\n",
       " 'This game caught my interest months ago, and I was watching it since then. I\\'ve been very cautious about survival games after the past few I tried have all let me down, bigtime. I usually shy away from PvP in games, so naturally I was hesitant to play this one. A few weeks ago, I received it as a gift from my significant other, and finally gave it a shot.\\nFirst of all, what worried me the most about this game, was the many many stories I read about joining and being instantly ganked, being killed in their sleep, being griefed, trolled, and every other horrible PvP thing that can possibly happen. So far I just have not experienced this. Maybe I have just been very lucky....but so far I have not yet ran into someone who instantly tried to kill me. Everyone has been friendly, saying hello on voice, offering supplies, and I even met a tribe leader that took me into the tribe to teach me the basics. I just have not seen the toxicity that some other reviews talk about. But again, maybe I just got lucky. \\nThe game is beautiful. A screenshotter\\'s paradise. It is graphics intensive but Im able to play on high without many issues (I get short freezes when I enter a new biome while flying, that\\'s about it). There are also frequent latency issues on the official servers. \\nContent is added all the time. It seems like every few days there is a new dino being added, and there are pretty much daily updates. I saw many negative reviews that say \"the devs don\\'t care\", but I am not sure where that idea came from. Maybe I\\'m missing something, but they seem quite passionate about the game to me. \\nFor me the game is very addictive. It is HARD for me to get \"sucked into\" a game on Steam. I usually play for about 12 hours and then move on. But so far in Ark I\\'m at 60 hours and usually log off still wanting to play more.\\nThere are some small things that bug me, and they are kinda silly things...mainly the artistic freedom the devs use on the dinos. I know they said they aren\\'t going for total accuracy, but small things like the Stego having 6 tail spikes instead of 4 makes me roll my eyes. Same with the two downwards-pointing horns on the Ankylo\\'s chin. Just minor things.\\nOverall for me, the game is one of the best I\\'ve played on Steam so far. I am really loving it, and look forward to logging in every night.',\n",

       " 'This is a review of the offline game.\\n          This game has been one of the best games I have ever played. I have been playing games for over  25 years and haven\\'t experienced a game this epic. I\\'d like to share one of my quests.\\n           I had just finished my first base on a peninsula. It had a bed and some storage containers and was starting to feel pretty safe. I hadn\\'t seen many dangerous Dino other that dilos (the ones that killed the fat guy in Jurassic park). I had stockpiled some goods and decided I would go try to tame something worth taming. \\nI found a raptor in a valley surrounded by rocks and decided he was gonna be my buddy. The taming process was pretty intense so it really made me want to keep my Raptor safe. I saddled him up and decided to give him a go. He was amazing, we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me. \\nAfter I respawned back at my base I was in panic mode and jumped on my only other ride able Dino which was a Parasaur and hauled♥♥♥♥♥back to where my raptor was. We never made it. About halfway there we were attacked by a pack of raptors and both were killed. My next re-spawn was kinda bleak from the start. I re-spawn in a random location that I thought would be near my Dino. After what seemed like hours of carefully navigating my map back to where i though my Dino was I started to freeze and starve. I would move thirty to fifty feet and whistle then repeat. The sun went down and my hopes for recovering my dino with it. Just as I had given up hope I was surrounded by scorpions and I thought \"oh well\". A second later my Raptor jumped down from the rocky ledges above and killed one of the scorpions. I frantically jumped on his back and ran from the other scorpions. My health was still falling due to the cold and me starving. Once we got to relative safety I hopped off his back and checked his inventory. Somehow he had collected a full suit of armor and plenty of berries whilst we were hunting earlier. We eventually dodged meat eaters and found our way home once the sun rose. \\nI have never felt that since of disparity and relief from a video game before. It sounds funny but it really felt like the raptor saved my life. I\\'ve never got that into a game before. That one experience was worth more than what I paid for the game.',\n",
       " \"Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefing, I feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers.\\nRight now I got close to 130 hours in the game, about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvE, all official ones. All the thing people say about the griefers is true, they'll kill your dinos, steal your stuff, abuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And that's the keyword here TRIBES. If you're playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that you're not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with it's little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourself, taking everything in, eventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth.\\nI'm sorry but I got to burst your bubble right now: If you plan on playing in a PvP server you gotta take this game seriously. You either find a group of friends to play with you or you join a Tribe as soon as possible. If you play alone you might find a hidden spot where your stuf will be safe one or two nights, maybe even a week, but alone you're doomed to be found, robbed and killed. And like many others said, have the work of a whole week go down the drain. If you're joining a PvP server you're doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure you, thing can get really intense, really epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deaths, or tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havok, T-Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at them, auto-turrets spewing bullets at your Carno army, Sabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold.\\nBut you'll only experience that if you join one of the dominating tribes on your server or work on creating a strong Tribe of your own. Otherwise you'll just be cattle for them, nothing else. They'll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccess, block caverns so only they can harvest the resources, literally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on.\\nI get why so much people hate that, after all they're just being preayed upon, they're not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right now, they gotta allow people to be complete a-holes because during wars that's what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale.\\nBut if everything I said right now put you off, don't be. First of all because you don't really need PvP for this game to be fun. There's a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinos, just hit level 45, and I feel like I'll never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE servers, they'll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rex, help you gather Prime meat when you're taming a Carnivore, give you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them.\\nAnd if you're still one of the guys who wanna grow at your pace and only participate on PvP when you're ready, REJOICE! Because they'll soon add War Declaration to PvE servers, so tribes can actually go at war when they feel like it, without all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves.\\nAs a closing statement, I'd like to congratulate the Devs. They're doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT better, still not there yet, but much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarer, in fact I don't even remember the last time I experienced one.\\nAn all around great game that I fully recommend if you're into dinossaurs and survival games. Oh, and it's also pretty cheap.\",\n",
       " \"Note: At least 1000 of my hours were spent on Official Servers. Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers.\\nArk Survival Evolved is a game that will make you feel many things.  Initially you will feel frustration at your helplessness as you spawn nude on a beach at level one and can barely fend off the smallest of dinosaurs.  Then you will meet people, these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and over, or they will be really chill, and you'll form a tribe with them.  You will spend countless hours with these people: farming materials, taming dinosaurs, and build bases.  You will grow more and more in power.  You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down.  You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e. the big tribes or friendly tribes).  You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribes, French and German, all while growing more and more powerful.  You will on occassion have a set back, but at this point you're on a roll and now the games mechanics, have a good group of friends, and objectives that you have given yourself.  You will feel happy with what you have accomplished.  \\nBut there is a downside.  There must always be conflict, while it can be delayed for long periods of time, it will eventually come.  And so another tribe will pick a fight with you.  Your tribe will fight their tribe, and you may lose or you may win.  Either way you've invested a lot into this server and these friends, so you'll never give up.  Some other tribes will jointhe fight, picking sides.  The winning side will probably kill all the dinos, take all the mats, and kill everyone on the losing side.  Thus you have won your first war.  You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with.  Soon enough, you'll get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well.  Now the entire server is split 50-50, and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases.  Eventually you'll win though, and the other side will leave the server.  They'll be fed up.  As the enemies are now gone, you are happy once more.  You hated them just as they hated you.  \\nNow a long period of peace has passed, a couple weeks.  There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting.  Peace will try to be maintained through talks.  But it will fail in the end, and more war will arise.  This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain.  These two tribes will be dominant in every regard: leadership, tactics, dinosaurs, and materials.  Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server.  You will fight your heart out against your former allies.  You will destroy bases you'd once entered as a friend, now as an enemy.  You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with.  You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours.  The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end.  It will be exhilerating.\\nThen you win.  Then you are the supreme ruler of the server.  You are standing over the ruins of your former allies as you have proved yourself to be the mightiest.  But then it will hit you.  The sadness. As now all the people you had once known, months ago when you were just a little tribe starting out, will all be gone.  Everyone you'd ever fought with and fought against are gone.  While there is some joy in victory, it is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with.  Your tribemates will still play, but it's not the same.  Even if not in your tribe, you had a community. Friends. Foes. Maybe even lovers.  Now all that is gone.  You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart.  New people will always arrive to challenge you, but you'll always beat them down.  Destroying any hope they had.  You'll build fortresses that'll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos it'll cause server lag.  You'll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power.  Finally, you'll get bored and leave.\\nMonths will pass, and one day you'll see Ark still in your library and hop back on.  You'll log back into your old server.  Everything is different.  New names, faces, bases, everything.  Not a single structure you had built is left standing, not a single ruin.  All of it is gone.  The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that 'Ark can be harsh for noobs', but you could never tell them.  You could never tell them an entire servers history.  The hundreds of thousands of hours of work you'd seen put in by that ancient world.  The structures they couldn't ever even imagine.  The wars you'd fought and people you'd met.  You could never explain to them what it all had meant to you, for it is all now gone.  In it's place is a new world, completely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity.  You will be both extremely happy at this new world, and profoundly sad about the world that was lost.\\nArk Survival Evolved will demand dozens of hours to just get the basics down and get priorities straight.  To become a power on a server will take about a hundred hours.  To conquer a server will take a couple hundred hours.  To realize everything you lost and destroyed that you once held dear will take thousands of hours.  To atone for everything you'd done to those you once called friends will take an eternity.\\nIf you'll pour time and effort, no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions you've made than Ark: Survival Evolved.  Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game.  But you'll meet people you'd never have met otherwise, see things you never thought possible, commit acts that would make tyrants think you're true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ.  In the end, you'll feel stronger emotions then any you've ever felt from playing a game.\\n10/10 Masterpiece.\",\n",
       " 'I have over 200 hours into the game, compared to a lot of ARK players i\\'m still a noob so if you aren\\'t ready to turn this into a full time job, don\\'t even bother thinking about getting this game. I\\'ll explain why this game is a full time job later on, but basically it punishes any player that can\\'t or won\\'t play it 24/7. \\nFirst I\\'ll talk about the PvE. I started playing PvE on a private server with friends and had tons of fun discovering everything there is to enjoy. We started on The Center, the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps. The beginning is the hardest part for new players. Every dino you meet can easily kill a noob, even the spitter dinos. It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptors, but stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place. Once you get the base built, the game gets so much more fun. Every new dino you find is cool, and it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave. The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators. Our base got killed multiple times by alpha raptors, but it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and gaurd towers, there was still a threat out there that had to be beaten. Ofcourse once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymore and once you tame flying mounts you don\\'t have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring. We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challenge, and even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill? Harder versions of that boss? That\\'s why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game.\\nPro tip, don\\'t PvP. This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top. New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave. Let\\'s walk through all the reason PvP is horrible.\\n1.) Alpha tribes. They wipe the server once or twice a week and completly blow up any new players base and kill their dinos. They own the server, they won\\'t let anyone else even enjoy the game.\\n2.) Unless you\\'re alpha, you don\\'t get a base, they might let you live in a thatch hut. Refer to reason 1.) \\n3.) Unless you\\'re alpha, you don\\'t get to tame dinos, they might let you tame dodos. Refer to reason 1.)\\n4.) Unless you\\'re alpha, you don\\'t get to upgrade any of your gear. Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto-turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them.\\n5.) Alpha tribes are literally impossible for smaller tribes to fight. They have huge metal bases with hundreds and hunderds of turrets and plants that will mow you down if you so much as look at it wrong. Rockets get shot down in mid air by these turrets, and you won\\'t get close enough to plant c4. You won\\'t be able to bring dinos to tank the turret either, refer to 1.)\\n6.) Offline-raiding. Just imagine working for 2-3 weeks building a pretty cool base completely surrounded by plant-x and taming about 20 dinos then logging on to see a smoking crater where you base was. You don\\'t get to save any of your gear, you don\\'t get to save any of your dinos, you don\\'t even get to fight back, it\\'s all just gone. This happens all the time, and honestly offline-raid protection should be baseline on all servers.\\n7.) Battlemetrics. Alpha tribes and griefers use this website to figure out if you are online or not. If you log off for some reason, sleep or work or whatever, then they will know and they will raid you. They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or on, or if anything else unusual is going on on \"their\" server. Basically, this site and sites like it are cancer. Also, it doesn\\'t tell them your in game name, but you steam name, that means even if you make another character they will know it\\'s you. Also, if you♥♥♥♥♥♥them off and try to go to another server, they can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you. There is no hiding and no escape, so you have to be nice and can\\'t even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to.\\n8.) Breeding. Just another way to keep big tribes ontop. They have huge metal air-conditioned rooms where they hatch 20 eggs at once, each hatched dino gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will have.\\n9.) Tek gear. If the fact that they have 2-3x better gear by monopolizing all loot crates wasn\\'t a big enough edge, if the fact that they have 2-3x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasn\\'t a big enough edge, now they get tek gear too. If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinos, you are DEAD!\\n10.) Ark is a full-time job. You must log on every day to feed dinos or they will die. Breeding and imprinting are horrible and time consuming processes that I won\\'t even touch. You must log on every day to make sure you haven\\'t been raided, and you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders. Don\\'t try, you won\\'t. \\nLook, I\\'m tired of typing this review, just know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skill, then don\\'t PvP. No Pvp skill required at this point, their gear will have much higher armor and damage, their dinos will have much higher hp and damage, just accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you won\\'t even be online to defend it, not like you\\'d have a chance if you were.\\nEDIT:\\nI never expected my review to actually be popular, but now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that I\\'m still a noob who doesn\\'t know what he\\'s talking about.\\nFirstly, this is NOT a skill based game. This is a grind based, offline raid based, exploit based game. You can\\'t come here and say I\\'m a noob, especially when I\\'ve played the game solo as a small tribe for over 300 hours, and I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale. My opinion actually got even worse after joining the aplha tribe, because I realized just how bad the game panders to these alpha tribes. Here are some more reasons I found from my time with the alphas why I will never recommend this game to anyone.\\n1.) Alpha tribes can grind resources WAY easier than a new player. Now, you would probably expect this. After all, they have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1. No, numbers isn\\'t even what I\\'m talking about here, I\\'m talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal. A noob with a hatchet can get 50-60 wood from a single tree. An alpha tribe can get 1500 wood from a single tree. A noob with a pickaxe can get 50-60 metal from a vein, an alpha tribe can get 300 metal from a vein. A noob would take hours to farm 1-2k metal, an alpha tribe can farm 20-30k metal in an hour. The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier. Now, noobs wont know how to do this, and wouldn\\'t be able to because Quetzals are hard to tame, and hard to hide from alpha tribes. If they saw you flying around harvesting, they would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your base.\\n2.) Large scale PvP is extremely laggy. The servers are supposed to support up to 100 players, but if you get more than 20 players in a server, the lag becomes unbearable. Once again, Alpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server (kind of like DDOS) to block out defenders from connecting, or to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from things.',\n",
       " \"First review i wrote for a game but it had to be done!\\nThis game is like Crack! \\nI've put a few hundred hours into this game and will probably put in a few hundred more. The devs are constantly pushing out new content (to a point where all the server maintenance is starting to become annoying haha) and they are very involved with the community trough reddit etc. \\nMe and two friends of mine started off on a public server and had a really nice welcoming, A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we we're hooked to the game pretty much instantly. There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone.\\nA few weeks later. \\nwe have a huge metal base with a 5 high stone wall perimiter around it and 5 more people joined our tribe. All the big tribes but the chinese one left the server and got wiped out. And it seemed peaceful At this point we already spent hundreds of hours taming different dinos (which each have their different role like gathering resources, carrying heavy loads, transportation, combat, you name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t-rexes and the stronger end game dino's. You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dino's as well which makes the game even better.\\nOne week later.\\n Random (smaller tribes) are getting destroyed at night when they are offline. all the buildings blown open resources stolen and dinos killed. (take note some dinos can take over 10 hours to tame without kibble) At this point our base is more like a fortress we have over 70 organic turrets (think plants that split acid to hostiles) and 10 auto Gatlin turrets with loads of ammo in them. And an army of all kinds of dino's over 50 including 5 t-rexes varying from lvl 150-200+ A fully metal layered base with different compartments with different resources in every room (makes it harder for raiders to get everything since they have to blow up more walls) \\nThe chinese tribe starts putting in random text in global chat in capital letters including our tribe name. they have always helped us out we have made multiple trades with them for resources and called them allies. \\nThe next day. \\nI log on.\\nEverything is gone.... all our dino's are dead every wall is blown up all our turrets taken out. and our base is in ruins. \\nHundreds of hours of building up Taming dino's training them taking them out on resource runs and working together with a tribe....gone....\\nThe chinese tribe who helped us out from day one, Destroyed us.\\nRIP.\\nAtlas\\nAbraxis\\nNien\\nTalon\\nAeon\\nMckitten\\nMcCat\\nMcMuffin\\nMike the trike\\nBob the trike\\nArmageddon\\nMorgoth\\nApocalypse \\nAnkrahmun\\nAnkaderp\\nMuffin\\nDeem\\nDemonspawn\\nSharkenator\\nLulu\\nRammus\\nRockey\\nStoney\\nScorpenator\\nMitten\\nRappy\\nOmega\\nMammutan\\nWoolly\\nMamenamenamenan\\nCarny\\nBrontenator\\nAnd many more....\\nThat empty hollow feeling seeing your base in ruins and all your tamed fed and cared for dino's dead. I never had that before in a game.\\n3 days later.\\n we set up camp a few miles west from our old base. we had primitive tools and we were back to square one. \\nBut we we're determined and longing for revenge.... \\nwe broke down some old metal walls en made a small 4x4 room and set up the basic crafting stations. We had good contact with a few of the smaller tribes nearby who we helped out countless of times. now we needed their help. we secretly banded together against the Chinese tribe and they gave us some of the harder to obtain resources like crystal and oil.\\nWe started mass producing grenades.\\nI went out at night with a stash of metal tools a crossbow, arrows and food and approached their base. The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dino's in. I went to the beach. swam underneath the base. found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside. Found a good spot and made a start. tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall. Out came charging a T-rex and 5 raptors at insane speed. we started backing off while firing at them. The water slowed them down. Called for the rest of the tribe to head over. we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons. After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead. That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable. but we weren't satisfied. We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farm, we killed over 20 Stego's three mammoths and a few ankylo's, It was a massacre. Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends. \\nToday, \\nwe're still fighting a guerrilla style war against the Chinese. Constantly on the move hitting them where they expect it the least.\\nOnly a handfull of people remain on the server but we won't rest untill we have taken everything from them... like they did to so many others.\\nApoligies for the grammar mistakes etc. English is not my native language. \",\n",
       " \"I'm at a point where I'm about to hit 20 solid hours of gaming and feel I have a good enough grasp of the game to review it. So here goes...\\nI'm 32 years old. Been gaming since the Atari... been online since the early 90's. Done everything from chat based roleplay to full blown massive MMO's. I have a few hundred games on Steam and others on Origin, GoG, etc.\\nLet me say that this is the FIRST time I have EVER seen a developer quite like this one.\\nMake no mistake, this is an Early Access title. So of course the launch was plagued with issues, and the server numbers didn't cover the 100,000+ players... BUT, the devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that I've ever seen.\\nIn the first 24 hours of the game... we had over a dozen patches. In the first 48 hours... I can't even count how many. I recall yesterday having downloaded over 10 different patches through Steam. Seemed like one every hour. \\nFor me, that's HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product. You just don't see this type of response at all from an indie, or AAA team.\\nThat said... the game is pretty fun and exciting. I'd describe it best as Rust, with dinosaurs. Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine. The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release).\\nIn all, you can't go wrong picking this title up at this point. Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fine.\",\n",
       " \"+ Dinosaurs\\n+ Sprawling land that looks and feels absolutely huge\\n+ Ease of Understanding (controls, objectives, etc)\\n+ Engram System (I really dig it)\\n+ Simple Crafting (It's a no brainer to use and understand)\\n+ Early Access Perks (cosmetic items which are dinky but cool)\\n+ Loot Boxes! \\n+ Taming and Mounts (epicness)\\n+ Single Player (has been added!)\\n+ Server Hosting Instructions have been shared\\n+ PvE/PvP commands have been added for server hosting!\\n- Optimization: Needs massive improvement (which is happening! it's a priority with the Devs atm)\\n- Not enough servers to meet the current population\\n- Not being able to connect to servers/being kicked out of servers\\n- Sound issues (music/sound not turning down properly even when adjusted) \\n- Lag issues across the board. (Some experience it, some do not.)\\n- Raptors (dude, they will own your butt unless you hit a hill or something. Not really a Con, they're just d*cks)\\nWhat little I've managed to play I have enjoyed and really look forward to pitching a tent and staying a good long while but I'm not going to sugarcoat my experience either. There are a lot of problems right now but most of them are due to the Devs simply not pushing a bigger server test before they released -- They simply didn't anticipate the community that slammed their servers trying to play.\\nI'm recommending it, but please keep in mind that this is a VERY Early Access game despite the fact that there is a lot about it that simply looks, and somewhat feels, polished (the dinosaurs are amazing). If you cannot or do not want to deal with the current CONS then you should wait at least a week and come back and check out the changes the Devs push otherwise I'm saying go ahead and drop the 24.89$USD and try your hand at playing.\\nEDIT: 6/2 - Single Player and Hosting Commands have been added by the Devs!\",\n",
       " 'UPDATE: This game holds the record for largest sized game that isn\\'t released. Actually it holds the record for largest sized game period. Like why duh fug is it 108gb? even when it only downloads 30 it still allocates 108gb from my drive. And I have 100\\'s of games. Used to be 200\\'s until I wanted ARK back.\\nBEFORE YOU PLAY THE GAME\\n1.) Change inventory keybinding to Tab. Make console \"~\" Plays off very fluent.\\n2.) 5,000+ Negative reviews about optimization, You need more than just a great graphics card. This game is more CPU          dependant, I\\'m using an old 550gtx card and runs pretty smooth and with custom video settings it looks just fine. Tweak with everything for a few minutes, you\\'ll find a good enjoyable setting. Unless you\\'re running an old IBM pc. (lol)\\n3.) Note that you can customize your character down to hand size, male/female, etc. My only downside is somehow I still look the same as everyone.\\nOFF TO THE GAMEPLAY\\n1.) Unique inventory system, you have a mysterious impant in your hand which is the HUD for everything. You learn how to craft everything without a single blueprint through engrams, which better items require certain higher level. There are blueprints to find for a shortcut, but you never Really need them. EDIT: Blueprints can be BETTER than just the original engram I.E higher armor or durability. Survival is basic eat/drink over time it decays like rust, etc.\\n2.) Supply Drops, (I assume everyone is a test subject sent to this planet and these drops are hi tech packages warped to the land by the Army/Scientist) are also unique rather than a box that falls from a random helicopter. They are level restricted from level 5 to level 45 (so far I\\'ve seen). Can drop nearly anything in the game. I.E. Level 5 drop gave me an entire 1 square house, door and all. Drops have a cool and unique item model and the way drops work is just sci-fi-ish and refreshing.\\n3.) Crafting is Very seamless, pretty much a basic system though, which works just fine for replayablity. Repairs are on the spot until you get better items then you\\'ll use the Smithy. You can refine items so they won\\'t break when you level higher.\\n4.) Weather system/Temperature is neat. You get hot and cold, leading to burning or freezing to death after a long while. So far I\\'ve only seen rain and heavy fog as far as precipitaion. Hopefully while server days pass and development continues We will see snow and disasters such as tornados, typhoons, etc.\\n5.) Combat. Let\\'s be frank. Task Manager Says is all under processes = \"Shooter Game\" Basic swing and strike for melee. Iron sights for ranged. Online combat is sketchy due to ping. But Singleplayer/Local is very solid. There are multiple weapon attachments as well. \\n6.) Physics in the game are great, due to Unreal 4. But I will ADD THE FALLING DAMAGE NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED. At first I died nearly encumbered falling from maybe a 3 meter drop (thinking, oh I had alot on me it would hurt more). Only to die off the same drop being naked to get my gear back. So water, landscapes, foliage, all great. But FALLING DAMAGE NEEDS TO BE REDUCED. \\n7.) Dinosaurs (they are currently adding a multitude of species). Right now there are maybe a dozen different dinos and animals. Like a sabertooth tiger, mammoth, sharks etc. All very well produced and modeled. Sometimes pathing is a little bad, I kill T-Rex\\'s and Bronto just because they get stuck in trees or up a mountain side. Other than that, all dinos attack as they should and look great doing so. The taming method is very tedious, but unique. If you USE a nonlethal weapon on a dino they will go unconsious, which will have a meter telling you how long, and also a meter bar for taming. You simply place the food in their \"inventory\" wait and protect. Simple yet tedious. Making saddles are level required as well. (i\\'m to the point in local-play to just \"~ ForceTame\")\\n8.) Building is best described as rust or h1z1. Simple place foundation and addon. Yet there are alot of extra things you can do, such as catwalks, ladders, water pipes to transport a water source 17423 miles away. Also pipes can help you find your way around areas (I used some as placements and arrows). There is a modern aspect to building as well. Such as air conditioners, refridgerators, lamps, turrets, all need to be powered by generator and electrical wires. So that\\'s a grade A move, on my part. Also if you play online just simply beware, this is a survival game. Meaning people are psycho.\\n9.) Finally last and foremost, you can defecate,♥♥♥♥♥♥ poop, take a number two, talk to a horse named john, pop a squat, and pick it right up to fertilize your crops (which is VERY nessecary in my case)\\nSO OVERALL\\nThis game is still in development, it does have it\\'s lower qualities, which I mentioned. BUT, I can see why this game is coming to my Xbox One and PS4, rather than Rust, Dayz (never happening), H1Z1 (who is really gunna play that?), or many other survival games. It is simply because this game has all of the qualities of a AAA game and showed them to a playable extent, which companies like Steam, Sony, and Microsoft will gladly support. And for people who have not been able to play the game. Buy it on your Next Gen console because \"PC master race, right?\" \\nThanks to anyone who reads this long a$$ review. I\\'ve enjoyed the game, killed Broodmother and now resting as a humble Turok. I do think you should try it out before it is bought out by the $60 greedy game publishers. It is fooking worth it.',\n",
       " 'After a few hours playing i just felt i had to type down something about the game. First off the game looks realy nice, no way i could say it was a early access game if i didnt know it alrdy. No major game breaking buggs so far, some bigger dinos stuck between trees but so far i just seen a handfull of them.\\nA few highlight of my gameplay\\nWoke up on a beach and started to get the feel of the game and controls. Looking around  i saw another player working his way  thoward the forest and i tough: hey ill stalk him and see what hes up to. a few 100 meters into the dence forest he gets attacked by what i think was a Trex feeling for a snack. i didnt stay to check what happend to the guy, i legged back to the beach where i woke up. \\nNext few hours i was working my hardest just to get though the nights without falling to the smaller reptiles prowling the beach. Though to myself after makeing a spear, fish should be easy food to catch, I swam out to a big boulder just where the sea got alittle deeper, spotting a fish getting rdy to jump into the water and spearing it i saw a big shadow comming closer.... a shark the size of 2 cars....\\nI spend a cold night out on that rock.\\nWorking my way north along the shoreline looking for a good spot to call home i came across a dino that was left for dead that i decided to tamed. Over a period of 3 ingame days and nights feeding it and defending it and me the entire time. Gathering berries and makeing a campfire to cook myslef some meat and for light for the night times. After 3 long night and days he finaly woke up and i had my first companion.\\nFor a time all was well i was building the house on a hill loverlooking the shore, My dino i came to call Fido was defending me and the house without mercy. Oneday i felt the gound shake as a pack of big herbivores deciced that my house was totaly in the wrong place and started to attack it. Fido the good guard dog as he was attacked without delay. Outnumberd and outpowerd we fought them side by side for almost 30 min killing off 6 of the 8 attackers when Fido didnt have anymore fight in him and fell to the ground to never raise again. I without any backup was no match for the remaining two and i had to fall back into my house and gather as mutch of my resources i could carry and the flee. The only thing i could do was to watch from afar with my spyglass the destruction of my house and mourn the death of my brave Fido. \\nWould i recomend to buy it? Hell yes :)',\n",
       " 'This story requires a bit of setup.\\nLast year, a friend of mine whom I\\'d known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a \"Grandmaster\" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.\\nFlash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it\\'s so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.\\nOn Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn\\'t show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it\\'s difficult to accept that we\\'ll be going it alone now.\\nWe contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.\\nI not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can\\'t wait for).\\nThanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.',\n",
       " 'If you\\'re here at the crossroads asking yourself \"Destiny 2 or Warframe?\" - then perhaps this review might clear a few things up for you!\\nTo start with I have around 190 hours at the time of writing review and I approximately started playing Warframe around 3 weeks ago. I initially was looking for a game to keep me occupied whilst waiting for the Destiny 2 PC release.\\nNow I played Destiny 1 non-stop, I mean I grinded that game so hard for 4 months, achieved absolutely everything possible, obtained everything and then never touched it again. Don\\'t get me wrong, I LOVED those 4 months. But this isn\\'t a review about Destiny, but rather about Warframe... And man is it a good game!\\nWarframe at times can feel a bit overwhelming, there certainly isn\\'t  the type of hand-holding that Bungie provide you with in Destiny. Whilst this hand holding can seem helpful at the start, it soon turns into a glass ceiling. Forcing you to go in a particular direction or playstyle - there is non of this in Warframe. \\nIn Warframe the universe is an open book and you approach it however you would like. There is a general linear progression to the missions, you unlock one planet move onto a next and so on, but warframe really lets you choose how you tackle this. The weapon system in Warframe is a prime example of how open it is: You can pick a starter gun, and because of 100\\'s of mods available, this starter weapon can still kick a** in mid to end game! Every Primary, secondary and melee weapon feels unique and there are so many ways to alter these weapons: Want a machine gun that sets enemies alight? No problem, just add a Fire Mod! Want a bow that fires 2 arrows instead of 1? No problem, add a multi-shot mod! Want both of those? No problem, add both mods!\\nThat\\'s just the weapons, wait till you try the warframes! There are about 30 or so different warframes (basically characters) and each has 4 unique abilities. Each warframe is suited to a particular purpose: You like to control the sea and summon a Kraken to throw enemies about? Hydroid\\'s your guy! You like to set every enemy on fire and watch the world burn? Ember\\'s who you\\'re after! Want to heal the rest of your teammates and be the lifeline of the team? Trinity is here! And guess what? Yepp, you can mod these just like you mod the weapons: Want more shield on your tanky Rhino warframe? No problem, we got that! Want more energy to keep using your abilities? Eyyy yepp that too! And that\\'s just 2 examples out of hundreds!\\nCompanions I heard you say? Oh yeah well in Destiny you have a futuristic rubix cube who attempts to make jokes. Whilst in Warframe you have about 6 different companions, 4 war wolves, some cat/fox breed and an epic looking alien bull! All of which have their unique abilities and purpose... And yes you guessed it: You can also mod them!\\nNext is customisation... Now wow oh wow is this impressive. Warframe lets you customise pretty much about everything. On a warframe you can add skins, you can add armor pieces, you can add sigils (tattoo type things), you can add capes, you can change helmet style and you can change the colour of every single one of these pieces and aspects. The same goes for your companions and weapons. Also you can customise the colour and skin of your ship, you can even change the colour of the walls inside your ship! There\\'s ALOT to customise in this game, it\\'s quite impressive.\\nNow at this stage you\\'re probably saying: \"Yeah well I heard you gotta buy in-game currency to get access to this awesome stuff.\" Incorrect! Warframe has a whole in-game market/trading system that often fuels the crafting system. Meaning that you can sell the drops you get from certain missions to other players for the in-game currency. Or you can keep it for yourself and once you\\'ve got all the bits you can craft it! Either way you will eventually earn platinum and be able to buy the epic stuff you wanted.\\nLastly, the community. This is perhaps one of the nicest and most pleasant social aspects of Warframe. The community is so close, kind and caring. People have always helped me and some even gave me free stuff! This really is unique in an online game and boy is it nice to see.\\nAll in all, I came to Warframe to keep me occupied and now I\\'m hooked. I STRONGLY recommend you try Warframe, you will not be disappointed. Great work DE!\\n* EDIT 1: Thank you all for your thumbs up, feedback and comments! I\\'ll do my best to answer a few valid points that I\\'ve seen come up in the past week or in the comments.\\n1) \"Certain Warframes are OP\" - Well Yes and No, I don\\'t think the term over-powered can be used here. I think certain Warframes are more USEFUL than others, but then again that will entirely depend on what mission or purpose you are doing. For example: Sure I can run through a difficult Spy mission with Ember (an incredibly offensive fire based Warframe) but I will have an easier and smoother time tackling it with Ash (a stealthy, silent, single target based Warframe).\\nIt\\'s also important to remember that a Warframe, weapon or even companion is only as powerful as the mods you put on it. Meaning that you can completely transform a warframe from something \"meh\" to something godly just by using the right mods, and good ones too! But remember, the better the mods, the harder they are to find / more expensive they are to buy with plat!\\n2) \"The graphics are horrible\" - I\\'m going to use World of Warcraft to demonstrate my point here (I\\'m sure there are many other examples, but WoW is the one I can think of right now!): - World of Warcraft is a long-running game and like in Warframe, the often beginner areas (which were created right at the start of the game) look barren and terrible. This is somewhat true about the first few planets in Warframe, certain areas at the start look lifeless and without depth BUT as you progress, the planets become more detailed and graphically nicer.\\nFurthermore, recently DE just remastered Earth (the first planet) and it looks MUCH nicer! So be patient, DE definitely know that certain areas look crud and they are working on it I\\'m sure! I expect more planets will get a make-over just like Earth in the near future.\\n3) \"Plains of Eidolon is boring and filled with bugs \" - Okay sure, Plains of Eidolon (the newest, semi-open world area) is not entirely what we expected but think of this: This is the first time DE have attempted anything like it, they clearly said prior to the release that they were expecting feedback and will continue to add more content to PoE. They are a small studio and don\\'t necessarily have the resources that large studios like Blizzard or Activision might have. Give them time, give them feedback and be patient. I am almost certain that in the coming weeks DE will be adding more content and tweaking the existing stuff to make it smooth and enjoyable.\\nAlso, Plains of Eidolon is not meant to be the bulk of the game, there are still many other planets and things to do! It\\'s just a new area in an existing planet. Everyone chill and give DE some room to breathe and work things out, they have in the past and they will do so now too.\\nThanks again all!',\n",

       " 'Warframe is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I\\'ve had moments were I really loved it and there have been numerous moments where I\\'ve wanted to smash my desk with a sledgehammer. \\nI\\'ll just write a short and simple review.\\nCombat - 8/10\\nReally satisfying and fast. But the late game can get stressful and too hectic.\\nMovement - 7/10\\nMostly same as above, but what brings it down a bit is the numerous enemies that kill your momentum and the Co-op elements.\\nMultiplayer - 5/10\\nGreat in the beginning but it really gets dragged down in the higher levels where all players just speed around the map to the objectives and it starts to feel more like a speedrun. I always found it annoying when people would just race past enemies and do all these exploits just to get through the level faster and I would struggle to keep up.\\nStory - ?/10\\nI don\\'t have much to say since the story is unfinished, but the little that I\\'ve seen thus far is pretty interesting.\\nVisuals - 8,5/10\\nAbsolutely stunning. The lighting really makes the game. It\\'s so bright and vivid, and it runs great I might add. And I really like the designs for all the different warframes and cosmetics.\\nMissions and objectives- 5/10\\nThis is sadly the weakest point of the game. The missions and levels get really repetetive and grindy. And trying to get new gear can sometimes take weeks. (Including build times) This is the part where you\\'re really reminded that this is a F2P game. I would\\'ve prefered to pay for a full game with less of a grind since I\\'ve already spent way more than 60$ on rushing items and buying cosmetics. I\\'ll add that I\\'m not a fan of grinding (which is why I\\'ve spent so much money on the game.), I know some people are and kudos to you if you\\'re into that stuff but I\\'m not.\\nKeep in mind that these are my personal opinions and experiences.

Well, the nearly monthly, \\n, can completely change this game. With the Plains of Eidolon just on the horizon, this game will go from mission based to open world. This is the sort of game that \\n. Imagine Destiny, but Destiny 2 was a free update. \\n. Not P2W at all, and is SO generous you\\'ll probably spend money just to donate to DE! I highly recommend this game. Why not try it? \\nWarframe, a universe thriving with lush, hidden lore. The place where a species of technologically crude, and industrious Grineer have made home. The place where a plutocratic, advanced, and money greedy Corpus have made home. The place where a technocyte plague known as the Infestation has made home. Ah, and of course.. the place where you, the noble, honorable, Tenno; have made home. \\nWarframe is a free to play done right, everything in this game can be earned for completely free. You know how I know? Well, I\\'ve been getting EVERYTHING for free, and have spent a fair amount of hours to get this info!\\nThis game has thousands of mods. Unlike its \\'comparable\\' Destiny, this game has more than a dumbed down skill tree. This game has a modding system. One which lets your power have billions of stat combos.\\nThis game allows for player to player trading. Whether you\\'re looking for \\'prime\\' gear, or platinum (premium currency), trading has you covered. There are people willing to trade you for mods, gear, and platinum.\\nThe UPDATES, now this is a big one. This game Warframe has had so many updates, nearly on a monthly basis that it could EASILY have had a Warframe 2 by now. For a game being completely free, these updates are WELL worth your time. I mean hell, for the first time, we\\'re getting an enormous expansion adding open worlds! (which we all know will be expanded to every planet).\\nThe memorable moments. One, undeniable fact, is that this game gets sweeter as time goes on. With monumental quests such as The Second Dream and The War Within, this game will blow you out of your socks. Though, for some, this can take up to 100-200 hours to get to. It\\'s crazy, but gives you the best feeling and memory afterwards.\\nYour Space Mom. Every Tenno needs to feel like they have someone.. SOMEONE! For the longest time, in the game, I was closest to my dear space mom. The Lotus!\\nThe soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous, I know this is a random one but it can really hit you in the feels later on. Try looking up \"This is What You Are - Keith\" <- It\\'ll bring you to a Warframe song that is too good..\\nThe grind can be unrelenting for some. For people like me, the grind was never bad because of my constant progression, but for people who aren\\'t patient or want things quickly (in a progression system) this might be a bit too much.\\nThe lore is very hidden. There is a story, but for some major lore, and theories on it, you\\'ll have to look it up on YouTube. If you\\'d like a good series I recommend StallorD\\nThe enemy scaling. For some people who love a hard challenge, the enemy scaling might be too much. Not exactly the ENEMY itself, but more specifically the ARMOUR on an enemy. It can be insane to even damage an enemy after level 100.  \\nDojo improvements. I think Tennogen should be introduced for the Dojo, more decorations should be added, AND massive group builds. I\\'m talking about decorations that require a load of resources. That way if you have a large and active clan, you\\'ll have special things that show your true power, and riches!\\nOn \\'Finisher\\' animations for the Nikana backslash, a mark/bodysplit hould happen. What I mean is that you do a diagonal slash across the enemies back, yet no deep cut appears, or body splitting? I dunno, just a request!\\nPlease add a flashlight we can toggle. Especially with the release of PoE, seeing in the dark is crucial. Either an option to turn on and off the flashlight manually or nightvision would be greatly appreciated. I don\\'t know about anyone else but seeing in the dark hurts my eyes sometimes, oopsie!\\nNow please, note that this is all speculation and pure opinions! I love Warframe!

       " 'There are very few games that have held my attention for 1,000+ hours over the years, this is one of them. I created an account back when the game was still in Alpha (late 2012), back then it was was just a simple module with some enemies to kill with a handful of warframes to choose from. Even then though it showed promise. Over time they have added tons of content, new warframes, weapons galore, new planets, mission types, Archwing (fly in space!), events, clan dojos and foundry, player to player trading system, syndicates to join, player HUBs (relay stations), PVP, 8 player Raid etc etc. If you enjoy third person shooters, 4 player coop, pvp, raiding, RPG\\'s and/or ninjas in space (lol) this game is a dream come true then for you. Being that it is free to play there is literally nothing to lose checking it out. \\nThe game is a constant work in progress and the developer Digital Extremes (DE) is constantly tweaking and adding new content all the time. Warframe has a very decent crafting system and you will most likely find yourself trying many different warframes/weapons combinations to see which one(s) fit your style the best. Believe me the game encourages you to do so, it is surprising the amount of variety in the game. When you find something you like it is a rewarding feeling and you will too it is just a matter of time. Also decent customization for your warframes, weapons, Sentinels (companion), Kubrows (dog companion), Liset (your ship), with a multitude of color choices, skins and attachments.\\nEvery Warframe has its own set of individual abilities, they all have a total of 4. Some are better at being tanky, dps, sneaking (cloaking), solo play, healers, AOE damage, defense etc. There is a Warframe for every situation it seems. You can also make your own builds for each frame based on what mods you have (you attain them while playing missions they are dropped by enemies) For example \"Continuity\" mod allows for longer power duration time, when you ability is activated. More ammo, damage mods etc etc sooooo many. Making building your perfect Warframe/weapons very flexible and enjoyable. You have the opportunity to have a Primary, secondary and melee weapon. With the opportunity to make your own builds for everything here adds to the games replayability imo. Same goes for sentinels and kubrow companions they all have their own set of mods, especially made for them.\\nThat being said the game can be very grindy, especially for newer players. That is to be expected though being that it is an MMOish experience. Especially to gather enough resources and credits to craft your items. Well worth it though if you have the time to invest. Sometimes they seem to nerf warframes and weapons for no reason at all and then they rework it again and \"fix\" it. Nerf/Un-nerf is the nature of free to play MMO\\' ish kind of games. (Constant \"balance\" tweaking) This is not an instant gratification game either, the game gets better the more you play it. You can also purchase items with real money from the in game market, it is \\n necessary though. Most things can be attained just playing the game gathering resources and crafting them accordingly. Except, of course vanity items, skins, unique color palettes and limited time only items that have been available over the course of the game. \\nDE sometimes gifts players new color palettes and send them to your inbox (valentine\\'s day, halloween, St. Patrick\\'s day etc.) Free weapons too, they seem to do somethings special on the games anniversary every year. The developer also listens to community feedback and designs and have added many things based on that. Which is always a plus. The game can also get repetitive at times, but with the amount of content in game now that is harder to happen. You just have to mix it up from time to time and try new things within the game. \\nAll in all the future looks bright for this game. A Developer that actually listens to community feedback. Constant updates/hotfixes. Plus there is so much new content coming soon! Game is not perfect of course, but what game truly is right. There is a lot to enjoy here and unique setting and premise to the game, definitely sets itself apart from the competition.\\nMMO\\'s are hard to review, but at its current state I give this game a 4 stars ( ★ ★ ★ ★ ) out of 5',\n",
       " 'This game is evil.\\nAt first, you will be astonished by the super cool graphics and character/weapon designs. You will say to yourself \"How can this be free?\" And for the first 20 or so hours, everything will seem fine. But then, all of a sudden, you will match up with someone who has a way cooler frame than you, and you will look in awe at them, and every cell in your body will tell you \"You need to become that guy\". But then after doing some research online, you will realise that his frame is no longer obtainable, so you have to trade with some dude, who has dedicated atleast 1000+ hours to this dark ritual of a game. So, gullible as you are, you will start to slowly farm rare items, to gain enough premium currency to be able to afford this \"Frost Prime\". Then, after 20-25 hours of grinding, you will start to question your own exsistence, as you have only garned about a third of the platinum you need to buy that goddamn warframe. And then, in your hour of darkness, the game will hit you with a 50% discount on the premium currency. And in this hour of darkness, where all your mental defenses have been stripped away from the countless hours of relic farming, you will succumb to the dark lords. But not only will you buy enough platinum to afford the warframe of your dreams, you will buy one of the most expensive bundles, As the dark lords, known only in the common tounge as Digital Extremes, had intended. Because who wants to save 5 bucks, when you can save 50?\\nYou will powerfull for a time. You will feel as though nothing can stop you. Untill you run out of platinum, and the cycle begins anew.

       " ' I played ARK. I met a man named Jigger Jaw. He was Level 13. I was level 2. We hit it off, and ended up becoming a tribe and hunting together. All was well. He made it to Level 14, I made it to Level 5. But then, I saw a supply drop, in which he said he thought it was Level 15 needed to unlock it. Sparking my curiosity, I told him I would check it out. He stayed at the campfire and told me to watch out for the snake and frog-like creatures. So I got to the supply drop, and I could open it! I got many useful crafting items. I turned back to go to our campfire, but red words of death appeared. Jigger Jaw had been killed by a Level 80 dino. Gasping, I ran back to camp to find him. His remains were nowhere to be found, along with his killer. I messaged him asking if he was around, but got no answer. He had left. Later I found his murderer around the beach, and knew I was not yet ready to face this foe. But I was ready to survive. For Jigger Jaw had taught me how to survive. How to live.\\n1000/10, friendships made',\n",
       " 'At the time I write this, I have put about 3500 hours into this game. I have been playing it for over a year now and have had a lot of ups and downs. I play on a PvP server and I have had everything I had taken from me and all my tames killed many times. I have worked my way back up over and over and have managed to secure my tribe as a beta tribe on a server and am in an alliance with the alpha tribe.\\nThen Wild Card dropped Scortched Earth and the ability to transfer players and items into the server I play on. My server did everything we could to protect ourselves and it paid off. Then Wild Card made all the supply drops not effected by structures so they would still drop. So, we blocked them all off with vaults. Now Wild Card made it so the drops land on top of anything under them. We don\\'t have any defense against that.\\nWhy are we worried? Because for the better part of the last year, many servers have been taken over completely my mega tribes. Tribes that regularly hit server cap with who plays on the server. Who farm servers of all their resources and have been unchecked because no one could farm enough resources to fight them on their own servers. Now that they can travel from server to server, they are slowly working their way through all official servers and wiping the servers of everything.\\nFor people like myself who have dumped litterally thousands of hours into this game, we are doing all we can to defend, but we can only do so much as we can\\'t be online all day everyday. With the servers not being region locked, we have Chinese, Russian, and Australian tribes coming to our server during peak times for them, but the early morning hours for us. Meaning, we have no one on to defend what we worked hard to make. We now have to work in shifts, like it is a job, to defend what we have, all because Wild Card decided to open the arks up and have the players wipe the servers for them.\\nWhen a large server falls, most of the players quit playing the game. They move onto something else. That is good for Wild Card, because then the servers become low population, so they can repurpose them or remove them and that saves them a lot of money. They already made all they will make off of the players currently playing. So, if they remove us, they can save on server costs and use that for more advertising to get more unsuspecting players into the game.\\nOverall, Wild Card doesn\\'t listen to their players unless those players are praising how great the game is. The players that riducule the game, are ignored or banned due to rule violations. Wild Card doesn\\'t know what they are doing in terms of making a game that isn\\'t completely broken nor do they know how to have a conversation with their player base that isn\\'t just the positive things about the game. They refuse to hear or even acknowledge there is anything wrong with their game and that is a huge problem.\\nBottom line, only get this game if you\\'re going to play on unofficial servers or you like logging in and finding that everything you have is gone, yet again, and you get to punch a tree and start over.\\nADDED February 02, 2017:\\nI mainly talked about the PvP on Official servers in the review above, so I am adding the other ways to play the game here to hopefully give a more well rounded review.\\nSingle Player is nice as well, but nothing is persistant. So you need to increase a lot of rates in single player to make it fun. Like, at stock, if taming something takes 6 hours, you need to be logged into the game for 6 hours to tame it. If you exit, that timer pauses. Breeding anything becomes too cumbersome without increasing rates because 4 real life days that pauses when you exit the day is just not possible. Unless you want it taking 2 weeks to raise one thing. I just use single player as a \"creative mode\" to spawn everything in and build to see what I would need for the server I actually play on.\\nPvE is enjoyable but frustrating in a different way. You can\\'t build near others and as long as you close your doors, no one can take your things. People can annoy you and get in your way and just be asshats to you, and you can\\'t do anything to them because you can\\'t fight them. They can build walls around your base at the build limit so you can\\'t get out or in. It\\'s like the 12 year olds at malls that will be annoying little ♥♥♥♥♥ and and when you tell them to quit being ♥♥♥♥♥, they try to egg you on by telling you that you can\\'t do anything because they are a minor and you can\\'t hit them. Just really disrespectful. In some cases it\\'s worse than PvP.\\nThe unofficial servers are nice as it\\'s less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and more good players. Though, then you run the risk of the admins of the servers spawning in whatever they want and wiping the server anytime without notice. So, you could log in and the whole server is wiped and you lost everything. They could change up the mods on the server without notice and just shut the server down because they didn\\'t want to pay for it anymore. If you\\'re playing PvP on their server and you wipe them and become alpha, they can just delete everything you have, rollback the server to before you wiped them, spawn in a level 1million titanosaur and smash everything you have, or any combination of those.\\nMy biggest gripe with the game is that it\\'s not fun anymore. It was fun for the last year and with the last few months of updates, it\\'s just not fun anymore. You can have a lot of fun on unofficial servers, but they are also very volatile as well. Maybe more so than PvP official servers. The way I see it, is that if you never played this game before and you join a server, you should have fun right away. You shouldn\\'t have to join unofficial servers and add mods to the game to make it fun. To me, that says the developers failed at their job for making a fun game. Sure, int he future, you might get bored of the offical servers and mod the game to get some NEW excitement out of it, but you shouldn\\'t have to mod a game after you bought it in order to get fun from it.\\nIf Wild Card wants to keep all transfers open the way they have it now when you can transfer creatures, players, and items from server to server, then I suggest they do a full wipe of every server so everyone has a fair start to build up. Otherwise the mega tribes that basically own official servers have so much unchecked power to just wipe servers and take all their resources and get even bigger. There isn\\'t any hope to fight them off.\\nBut, if Wild Card just limits you transferring your character, that would be better as then you need to build up on a server. I have seen a few smaller tribes band together and wipe alphas that are just mean and ruin your day for fun. It happened on my server last year. The alpha we have now is friendly and helps the server anytime they can and uses their power to defend the server against attacks.\\nEDIT: I haven\\'t edited anything on this review. I just wanted to add that I replied in the comments to reply to the comments I received about this review.\\nEDIT 2: I still haven\\'t changed my initial review, just wanted to add two things that I know no one will read.\\n1. In my comments below that are back pages at this point, I made a typo regarding my family. I said they were all dead, I meant to say they were all dead to me. They are all alive, but very toxic, hateful people and I don\\'t talk to them unless I absolutely need to.\\n2. Since I posted this, I keep getting friend request from people. I\\'m denying every single one of them because I\\'m just assuming you are all trolls going to harrass me or come to my server and wipe it. Though, that would speed up the process of me quitting the game as I wouldn\\'t have anything left to go back to.\\nEDIT 3: I added into the main review about the other game modes so people would stop commenting about them. But, none of them will actually read the review and just call me names and say I don\\'t have a life. Which says a lot about them.',\n",

       " \"After many have tried, Studio Wildcards and associate dev-studios are trying to finally deliver us what we have all been craving for: A survival game with dinosaurs! ARK: Survival Evolved is pretty much exactly that, with an added twist of some unexplained sci-fi elements that all tie surprisingly well into the game. But is this Early Access title worth your money and time? Can we trust anyone after the Stomping Lands disaster?\\nARK puts you in the shoes of a half-naked guy (or gal), stranded on the eponymous ARK, the island the game takes place on. You do get the option to customise your character, although like in many other games, anything but the smack center for most sliders ends up looking ridiculous (hugely muscled, giraffe-necked dwarf or super tall, onyx-skinned valkyrie?), but it is still nice to have the option to go down that path. It should be noted at this point that your characters will be server-specific, meaning you can have one on every server. \\nYour character will start the game with nothing to his or her name, true to the survival-game code. You will quickly learn the ways of a hunter-gatherer, as your first task will usually be picking berries and collecting stones. You can also punch trees to get wood, but doing so will damage you (a dig at Minecraft? I like to think so.). \\nEven at this early point, the world of ARK does not try to hide its inhabitants from you. Huge, prehistoric beasts roam free over most of the map and there is rarely ever a moment during which you cannot see at least one dinosaur from your location. Not all of these creatures are trying to kill you, however, some just try to live their life in peace. They may even fight each other, as the predators hunt for prey and the latter defends itself. \\nPlayers should quickly realise that most of the island's monsters are beyond their combat-capabilities and that they should steer clear of the particularly agressive ones dwelling on land, in the sea and even the air. To help the players deal with these threats and offer some sense of progression at the same time, ARK features a levelling-system. You gain XP at a steady rate over time, with a bonus for doing pretty much anything from gathering and killing to crafting and building. Levelling up will allow you to increase one of your attributes, as well as spend points learning a new crafting-blueprint. While you are barely able to craft torches and stone tools at the beginning of your adventure, later down the line you may pick up the recipes for weapons, buildings and more tools to help you survive. All blueprints cannot be unlocked until a very high level, so specialising in a select few while working together with other players online can be a huge benefit. \\nThe unwritten goal in ARK, for most players, is to build a somewhat self-sufficient base for yourself and your tribe. Bases are built using a very simple and easy to understand system of square foundations with snapping walls on their four sides and flat roofs on top. Indeed, whoever has played Rust will immediately feel at home, as the whole game plays very much like it. This includes player's characters falling asleep and remaining in the world whenever their pupeteer disconnects, adding additional treat to potential raiders, who will be able to take all of your character's belongings even when you are not on the server. Of course, building a secure base will help combat this threat. \\nWhat sets ARK apart from Rust is its setting (frigging dinosaurs), its general artstyle (sci-fi-looking HUD and inventory/character screen), its graphics (looking seriously impressive) and the fact that you can tame your very own dinos! Instead of killing the giant murder-machines (or players), you can choose to knock them unconscious instead, beginning a rather lengthy taming-process during which you must keep the creature subdued while also feeding it its favoured food. Eventually, it will become your (and your tribe's) companion, able to aid you in combat, bear your burdens and even be ridden as a personal mount (works with flying dinos, too!). What more needs to be said, really.\\nYes of course, the game has had a rather shaky launch into Early Access. According to the devs, they did not expect such a large resonance initially, which caused most official servers to crack under the pressure and lag. Also, the stunning graphics of ARK come at a price: Your hardware will suffer. At this point in time, you need a fairly beefy machine to be able to play ARK at a reasonable framerate. The devs are aware of this and are currently working on optimising the game to maximise FPS and minimise lag. \\nAll of this was to be expected, really and is in no way reason to give ARK a negative review. In fact, the devs claim one of the reasons for the current performance-issues to be their initial focus on content, wanting to give players enough things to do ingame for Early Access, which I think speaks volumes about the good intentions behind this project. \\nIndeed, even for Early Access ARK offers a great deal of content and longevity through its progression-system and dinotaming-mechanics, with so much more planned for the future. The performance-issues are being tackled at the time of me writing this review and some first patches have already been rolled out, resulting in some great improvements for a lot of the players. I am very much looking forward to see more stuff added to ARK: Survival Evolved and I believe the very pleasant developers have the right ideas on how to steer it to success.\",\n",
       " 'First off. I know people are going to read this and go \"You have 1.5k HOURS IN THIS GAME HOW CAN YOU GIVE IT A NEGATIVE REVIEW?\"\\nEasy. I\\'ve played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. I love it. I split the time playing it between myself and a family member. Interacting with dinosaurs? Amazing. Building a base? Amazing. The overall concept of the game? Amazing. \\nThe difficulty? There are so many times in this game where something stupid happens and it literally has a domino effect on everything else. It\\'s immersive. You take ONE moment for granted while you\\'re mining, or picking some berries and out of NO WHERE you\\'ll get bum rushed by a large dinosaur who\\'s hungry and wants YOU and your TAMED animal for dinner. Within moments the flying mount you\\'ve spent HOURS taming can be gone. It\\'s infuriating. You get so mad, and then you go back, and you rebuild. You go find another dinosaur to tame. YOU won\\'t get beat by the game. Even at higher levels it\\'s difficult. It\\'s unforgiving, and for that I appreciate the game itself.\\nWhy can\\'t I recommend this game? It\\'s broken. I\\'ve been playing since Alpha and there are STILL snapping issues with buildings. You have structures that have clipping issues and make it difficult building things next to each other. You know minor things that can be fixed relatively easily that have just been overlooked.\\nSome of the dinosaurs are incredibly unbalanced. MicroRaptors  are hands down the worst thing ever introduced to this game. You literally have no way to combat them and they often come out of no where and are found near numerous other dinosaurs that have no issue taking a nibble out of you and your mount while you\\'re stun locked for 10 seconds. It\\'s hard enough being knocked off of your mount. This is just one of the examples I can give as far as how over powered some of the dinosaurs abilities are.\\nConstant bugs. This game had NO business exiting early access. I can honestly say that. Every single time you roll out a patch you\\'re breaking something within the game. It doesn\\'t necessarily have to be a large patch like the recent one with aberration. Often times it\\'s small little patches that cripple the game system to the point where it\\'s unplayable. I recall a patch not long ago where anytime you went to harvest stone the game would just hard crash each and ever single time. \\nStuff like this shouldn\\'t be happening to a game that\\'s out of Early Access. \\nQuite simply. This game was not ready for a full release. It still is not ready for a full release. You shouldn\\'t have game breaking bugs every single time you release a patch. A proper game that is ready for release is Polished. It functions. This game does not fit either of those criteria. It\\'s understandable to have SOME issues with each major patch, and we appreciate how often Wildcard releases patches and adds things to this game, but this game is still by all means an Early Access title. \\nFor that reason, and that reason alone. I cannot recommend that others buy this game. Not until Wildcard fixes some of the glaring stability issues that it has.',\n",
       " 'tl;dr — worth it, loved it, but I\\'m not very hardcore. 300 hours on record, 100+ of those with my kids. \\nAnd now, STORYTIME: \\nI love playing co-op games with my kids. When I looked at \\n (currently in Early Access on Steam) it looked like just such a thing. When I dug into it and learned that I could host a LAN server in my house, and edit The Island to be a bit less deadly and a bit more generous, went all in with my sons.\\n \\nBefore long I had all four of my kids playing with me, and each other.\\n \\nCurrently my girls are the heavy hitters, training mobs of small dinosaurs, and then marching them into harm\\'s way. The game\\'s A.I. spawns some tough beasts, but short of the epic boss battles (which we have not bothered with), and the Alpha T-Rex (which we haven\\'t run into), nothing stands for long against Keliana\\'s swarm of dilophosaurs and dimorphodons, or Gleek\\'s hopping mob of giant frogs.\\n \\nKeliana and I did run into a bit of trouble with our expedition from the north-east river mouth, but that wasn\\'t her fault. I shall now tell you about it.\\n \\nWe  attempted to bring 24 tamed dinos and one tricked-out crafting raft southwest through narrows and swamps. We discovered, after it was too late to turn around, that the size of our mob and the size of our raft made the trip extremely tedious. It didn\\'t get dangerous until I got fed up and decided on a side trip.\\n \\nMy plan was simple. Ride Terry, my pteranodon who kept fouling the raft\\'s travel, from our mob\\'s location at the western edge of the Eastern Plains, east and south to a platform we\\'d been building in the middle of the Eastern Forest. There he\\'d be high, dry, and safe. I would then parachute back, timing my glide to get me most of the way to safety. It\\'s a high platform, and I\\'d seen my son make that kind of glide before.\\n \\n(Note: The logic that goes \"I saw my son do a thing in a game so it is a thing I can now do\" has never gotten me into trouble before, I swear.)\\n \\nA dimorphodon named Zed was following me and Terry. Unfortunately, Zed fell behind, and I forgot he was there. I landed Terry safely, lined up my jump, and leapt back the way we\\'d come. My chute popped perfectly, and my glide was going to be LONG. Then Zed caught up, flew straight at me, and fouled the lines of my chute.\\n \\nI dropped fast. Not killed-by-the-fall fast, but definitely short-of-my-goal-by-80% fast. I landed in a boulder-filled vale just to the west of the platform. The vale\\'s only other major feature besides boulders was hungry carnivores. I emptied my shotgun into a \\'raptor, then finished it off with a pike only to discover that a carnotaur had stopped quarreling with a pair of sabertooths, and was charging me.\\n \\nCarnos charge in straight lines, and turn poorly. I used the terrain to my advantage, and attempted to lead him back into his sabertoothed foes. It worked perfectly, except for the part where they decided to share a meal. I now had three carnivores chasing me.  I almost ran headlong into another sabertooth, but it leaped and I ducked, and then I kept running.\\n \\n\"Keliana, where are you?\"\\n \\n\"North of that purple light. There\\'s a cliff between me and you. You\\'ll need to go around it.\"\\n \\nI turned and checked to see how close pursuit was.\\n \\nI screamed.\\n \\nThe game does a really good job of getting predators right. They don\\'t roar or screech unless they\\'re fighting. They come at you teeth-first, and quietly.\\n \\nI had a perfect view of three sabertooths, one carnotaur, and behind them, just starting to take interest, a pair of tyrannosaurs who I may have run a bit too close to without noticing them.\\n \\n\"THERE IS NO AROUND!\"\\n \\nThe nice thing about video-game cliffs is that if they\\'re not sheer, sometimes you can cheat them, running sideways and down, and landing without having broken your bones. I did this, knowing that my pursuit could do the same thing.\\n \\nI splashed through shallows at the base of the cliffs, and then saw that I was being charged from the front by a velociraptor. It was over.\\n \\nThen I saw that the velociraptor had a saddle on it, and there was a woman in the saddle.\\n \\n\"I\\'ve got you, Dad!\"\\n \\nShe and the mob swept past me. I missed what happened next, because it happened behind me. I did get game alerts telling me that my tribe\\'s pets were killing things, but they went by too fast for me to count. I saw exactly zero flashing red alerts, which meant that Keliana had killed everything chasing me without taking any casualties.\\n \\nThat\\'s my girl.\\n \\nAre we playing this game the way it was meant to be played? If the online PVP tournaments are any indication, we\\'re doing it all wrong.\\n \\n \\nWrong is fine.',\n",

       " \"When you read these reviews please make note of the player's hours. (Not saying you need hours to judge, but that there is a reason many people have well over 1-2k hours in this game.)\\nArk is a childhood fantasy come true. It's like a mix of Jurassic Park and Minecraft with a touch of DayZ. Ark is the kind of game where if you ask for help or report a glitch on the forums you will be answered by an actual dev and the glitch will be addressed within hours to days. Wildcard Studios *from day one to the present* have been very responsive and are an excellent team.\\nI can't give a rating out of 10 compared to a complete game because Ark is an alpha, but as alphas go; 100/10\\nUpdate: Over two years ago I heard about a survival game where you could hunt and tame dinosaurs. I checked out their website, watched their announcement trailer- and got goosebumps.   \\n \\nTo this day Ark is the best EA game I've ever played. There have been a lot of changes and for a while I didn't like where the PVP was going, (booku saddles, forcefeeding bullet sponges, jet-powered Pteras, etc.), but there are always tweakable options so you can find or operate a server that's just right for you.\\nPeople are currently pumping out bad reviews for Ark based on its release price, (like 7k recent salty reviews because of money politics,) and things like the *completely realistic and justified* flyer nerf- Don't let their hate make you miss out on this game. Compared to the average AAA game Ark was a steal at 30$. So wait for a sale, you won't be disappointed.\",\n",
       " 'OK, I previously reviewed this before they announced an actual launch date.  I still stand by my initial review.  We played for over a year on an incredible community server.  There was still PVP but it wasn\\'t what the PVP has turned into.  You want these big wars they advertise with you riding armies across fields to PVP.  Keep looking for a different game because you will never see that in this game.  We initially had uninstalled due to how toxic the player base got after cross server transfers.  We saw the new Isolated servers and thought wow, finally a way for people to enjoy the game.  My husband played for a day on one server before being trolled and losing everything while offline.  He started over on a new server and I joined him because everyone he was running into wasn\\'t about just ruining his game. A few hours later we had a small house and a few riding tames.  I had just placed a feeding trough finally and was heading to my house to park and log off.  All of the sudden a guy on a raptor and a guy on a frog show up trying to kill me, so I get away becuase obviously after a few hours we have no defenses so I run. They proceed to blow a hole in the building I come back to ask why to which they then just keep me unconcious while they dump, not take my things just dump on the ground our entire morning of work.  Player base in this game is toxic, you can\\'t enjoy it, you can\\'t build, you can\\'t tame because someone will just come along in a few hours and destroy it all again.  I stick with my initial review.  Do not waste your money!  Game is still super laggy, even on extremely low memory it overheats our pc\\'s Some parts of maps are so glitchy you can barely make it through them.  It had the potential to be a great game but the humans playing it ruin any fun anyone gets. There is no need to attack people that have only played a few hours, have no turrets, live in stone and don\\'t even have a dino that can eat other dinos.  That is just being a♥♥♥♥♥♥  That is what this game is full of.  If no one lets anyone build you can never have true PVP because OP players picking on new players is not PVP.  Add to that the fact that for the most part developers didn\\'t listen to any of us when they made changes that affected gameplay, I mean why would you listen to the player base, what would they know about how your game actually plays.  Now a once awesome game was destroyed from the inside out.  Bad decision after bad decision and now they try to \"fix\" what they broke but the players are entirely too toxic to fix.  Players have found every way possible to exploit the game and find new ways to every day.  Maybe it\\'s not just this game maybe it\\'s just a sign of society in general.  I have noticed a change in the gamers out there no empathy, they cheat whenever they can, it\\'s all me, me, me with most of them.  Time to go back to the way life used to be actually interracting with humans so you can actually see the pain in someone when you crush their soul.  Maybe it wouldn\\'t be as easy to be such nasty cheating trolls in every game.  What\\'s the point of a PVP game if you never let anyone build so they are actually a fight?  Oh I guess you aren\\'t good enough to actually PVP so just keep trolling we\\'ll go elsewhere and tell our friends not bother.

I didn't know it was pvp until i was raided, but i realized my thatch wasnt't going to stop anybody, so i rebuilt a wooden fortress, tamed a few dilos and raptors. Find a few other noobs and make a family together. Working hard and proud on our home, we ventured through our island chopping down trees, and killing what we could. Then the server wiped. We understood it was a great time to move to a better location, block off a cave and pray no one f****s with us.

We liberate chinese held caves, and open them to the public. The whole server rallies to demolish the chinese griefer cells, and send them back to the stone ages.\\nFast forward a few more weeks, and things are peaceful. Expanded locations allowed us more resources and dinos, while also allowing fast travel locations.\\nThen you get big tribes trying to police the world.\\n My final straw was realizing a group of four, could never take on a group of 15. I tried diplomacy, but realized, why the f*** am i going to these lengths for some Dbag i don't even know?\\nI burned out on the diplomatic, and relations part of the game in pvp. Its too much of a pain to maintain those relationships constantly.\\nIf you're new, go pve to learn the basics. If you want to try you're luck at pvp, i'm all for it, its fun.

       " \"This is one of the best survival games I have ever played and it's only in early access right now. There is already a ton of content and the game looks beautiful. There are a few bugs here and there and the game still needs to be optimized for better performance (Devs said this is in progress already) but right out of the gates, this game is amazing.\\nThere currently is no tutorial for what to do or how to progress but it's a survival game so it's fun to learn the hard way, especially when the hard way means getting your body gnawed on by dinosaurs. When you first join the game you are welcomed by a character creation screen. You can choose either Male or Female and then customize your look. The customization is a little sparse at the moment with some awkward scale adjustments for the body. After fiddling around with it for a while, I just ended up going with something very close to the default look.\\nOnce you create your character and choose one of 4 general areas to spawn (North/South/East/West) you find yourself waking up on a beach and scratching your arm that has some weird implant in it. This implant seems to be the key to how you manage your inventory, crafting, and leveling up. The first thing you will notice when you start on your beach is just how good this game looks and it is truly beautiful. The sun is beating down onto the beach where the water meets the sand. The trees in the richly detailed forest sway in the wind and the grass and foliage cover the landscape before you. So much vibrant life all around you and then you see the dinosaurs. \\nThe dinosaurs are very detailed and bring a since of awe to the game just like the first scene you see in Jurassic Park. Luckily you see mostly herbivores but do be careful because there are some small carnivores you can run into on the beach as well. It seems that the most dangerous wildlife can be found more inland. That isn’t to say that these herbivores are pushovers. That triceratops or giant turtle will most likely kill at this point in the game, so don’t attack them just yet. \\nYou begin your hard life of survival punching some trees and picking up rocks until you can craft your first pickaxe and move on from there. You can collect berries and fibers from the plant life, bash giant boulders to smithereens, and chop down any tree. You will need all of these materials to craft better items, starting with some clothes to cover up your nakedness.  \\nThis brings us to experience. You gain experience throughout the game from doing any action. Collecting materials, crafting, and combat all add to your experience pool. If you are in a tribe you gain bonus xp from your tribe mates. Once you level up you get to choose one stat to increase permanently (health, stamina, attack, weight, etc…) and then you earn some engram points to use towards learning new items to craft. The more you level, the stronger you get and the more you learn to craft. So far this is the only way to learn recipes for crafting.\\nThis is a survival game as well so you have to keep an eye on your overall health. You can’t let yourself get too hot or cold, clothes, fire, and water help with this. You can’t let yourself starve so you need to forage for berries and hunt the wildlife. With eating comes defecating so make yourself regularly take a dump or your character will just act like a horse and take it anywhere they please. Actions require stamina and your character will tire if the stamina is depleted. You need to stay hydrated as well so go dunk your head in some water or craft a flask. If you take an excessive blow or fall from too high you will break a bone and walk at a snail’s pace so do be careful.\\nYou can hunt the dinosaurs in this game but you can also tame and even ride some of them. This process can be long depending on the dinosaur you wish to tame so be prepared before you do so. You basically either punch or shoot them with sling shots/arrows until they get knocked unconscious. Once unconscious you need to load them up with their respective food type (berries for herbivores, meat for carnivores). Make sure you have narco berries to feed them as well so that they can stay under for the entire time it takes. Some dinosaurs take a single in game day to tame while others can take multiple days. It is always easier to tame a dinosaur with a group of friends. If you have learned the ability to craft that dinos saddle, then you can also ride them to your heart’s content.\\nThis also brings us to the multiplayer interaction. This is a survival game so banding together with others increases your odds of survival. You also have to be weary of those who don’t have your welfare in mind and are only looking out for themselves. If you can band together you can create your own tribal town with dino protectors and likeminded players. This will also protect you from those looking to do harm. When you log out of the game your character goes to sleep and is vulnerable. If you have friends and tamed dinos, this makes it safer to log out when you are done. \\nThere is so much to this game and it is only in early access. The devs have promised a plethora of more content to come and I am looking forward to all of it. For now I will try and do my best to survive this harsh world.

I would make gains in the daytime and by night my stuff would be attacked.\\nI stayed up at odd hours to defend my property, eventually I was ground down and killed.\\nI went through 4 public PVP servers when the chinese invasion first hit. lost several tribes of good people who one by one fell apart under the pressure to keep things running.\\nIn that respect I feel the developers failed me as a player. they took a hands off approach and forever scarred my experience of the game.\\nNow my views on the game irrespective of social and dev issues:\\nPro\\'s: \\nthe game looks beautiful\\ngameplay is tight\\nsounds are good\\nAI is acceptable mostly\\nlots and lots of stuff to do\\nPVP and PVE\\nCustom servers\\nMOOOODS!\\nCon\\'s:\\npublic servers are really bad and not administered\\nThere is no offline protection\\nThere is limited enjoyment to be had from PVE as 3/4 of stuff is pvp oriented\\nthe game is a huge time sink\\nNow, the number one Issue i have is that, the  game caters to players who play all the time, like anyone who is a 3hr per day type person simply cannot play PVP or enjoy it. and if they do usually its on the backs of a group of people who play 11hr+ a day keeping things running and protected.\\nThis one single issue, is why the game annoys me, without offline protection, the game puts too much pressure on smaller groups forcing them to join larger groups simply to have any fun at all. this wieghting towards larger tribes basically destroys any aspirations of long term play for any group.\\nLife cycle within the game is basically.  tribes get bigger and bigger, biggest tribe rules and kills anyone who annoys them, and eventually starts killing people because they can, around that time, they usually force many smaller tribes out of the server and then eventually they break up and leave.\\nsomeone fills the power gap and it starts all over again.\\nThat being said, the game is fun, and rewarding, you can make great friends and have alot of fun. you can also subject yourself to sleepless nights. worry and lose friends over it. so its your choice how you play the game, but play it to have fun.\\n====== Post Transfers Review==========\\nSo, the developers reactivated transfering characters and dinos across servers, originally i was not a fan of this severely broken mechanic, but its grown on me over the past several months of play.\\nIt seems to have had the effect of making tribes get even bigger to keep thier servers safe from outsiders. but in the end, if someone comes to a server to wipe it. its being wiped no matter how much stuff you have or people you have. because you do not know its comming until its too late.\\nTheres definately some kinks to work out in the transfer system to allow defenders a better chance at protecting themselves from offline raids and across server invasions.\\nthe number of servers being wiped is steadily increasing as more and more tribes push out to attack old enemies.\\nLooking forwards to see how the developers change the transfer mechanic once they see how its being used.\\n===========Post Being part of a Baddass multi server alpha tribe===============\\nSo its been a few more months since transfers got activated, since then I became part of my servers alpha tribe, joined a multi server coalition of tribes for mutual defence.\\nFought off multiple tribes run by some of the biggest twitch and youtube streamers on ark official servers and generally had a bunch of fun finally getting back at some of those tribes who attacked me long ago.\\nIs ark still interesting to me?  yes and no.  while I enjoy the pvp elements of the game more and more, I no longer get a chance to just have some fun taming a dino or going out to craft and build things.\\nYou see once your tribe becomes truely huge, you just have too many bases to maintain or build, you have too many dinosaurs to look after and you have too many demands on your time from raising baby dinos to farming bullets and fuel and fertalizer to keep your defences running.\\nThe ark developers recently made certain resources be consumed faster so base maintinence is more annoying than it was. and with the impending release of the game, there are still many issues I have with the game that I would have expected to be fixed before release.\\nso Im taking a break for a while, maby after release ill do another review, hopefully things are sorted by then.\\n====================================== early post release review=======\\nLooks like many of the anti dupe protections now work, new servers, ect is cool.\\nbut... within a day everyone who was abandoned on the \"legacy servers\" came over to the new ones and took over every server which means alllll the new players basically got slaughtered and will have no chance to get anywhere thanks to power levelling.\\nsooo... i dont know... same game as before. doesnt feel released.',\n",
       " \"I would not recommend this game for ANYONE until full release, if that ever happens. I feel wronged by the new DLC and refuse to purchase something that should have been given free. I understand that it's early access and all that goes with it, but to charge for something that has been hyped for so long, and refusal to fix known issues, makes the game unworthy of recommendation for anyone considering purchasing this game.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, I recommend this game if you play on a private server or solo game. I have played over 2000 hours of this game. I love it. The art is great, the game play is great, but the public servers are not so great. \\n********************************************************\\nI do not recommend this game for public servers\\n********************************************************\\nLots of griefing in this game, especially from the players located across the Pacific Ocean. On public servers I and my tribe mates have been warding off invasions. It becomes a chore and these invaders use hacks and cheats which destroy months and even a year\\'s worth of hard work in very little time. With the re-instated server tansfer capabilities, it has gotten to the point where the game is unplayable and simply not fun. People blocking resources and not allying up is very problematic as well. Then if the invaders do take over various resources you and your tribe are hosed. The game is not balanced well for PVP, especially if the invaders have taken over other public servers, mining resources there and then transfering into your server. We\\'ve attempted blocking all the Obies and all the drops as to deter them and at the least trap them here. Unfortunately, that breaks the game play even more. \\nWithin the discussions, there are a lot of complaints about these invaders from across the Pacific. These discussions often times are \"locked\" from replies and or are deleted in order to minimize the exposure of the problem rather than providing an answer for the problem. One answer would be to follow in the steps of other studios, where these particular group of people only have access to servers listed for their country/region. I do hope this issue becomes resolved one way or another. It is sad that such a great game can be ruined by social behaviors. Unfortunately, the culture of certain countries do not view cheating as a bad thing. In fact they view it as \"a win is a win, no matter how it\\'s achieved\".',\n",
       " 'Well I have put in over 1,000 hours into this game so I don\\'t need to tell you that I enjoyed the game, but I will anyway.\\nBefore I dive into the actual game I want to talk cons. \\nThis game requires fairly constant attention if you play with other people. On Lan servers/Solo play this is not as much of an issue, but there are timers on a lot of things that will reset if you don\\'t play often enough. Buildings will be able to be destroyed/auto demolished after a certain number of days. After a set number of days pets will become claimable (this allows other players to take your pets before they starve to death), and then if left unclaimed they will starve to death. If you don\\'t have time and/or a lot of friends to play with it may be hard to keep up with the timers. Thatch houses give you 3 days, Wood gives about 7. pets are usually claimable at the time that wood buildings are allowed to be demoed (PVE) without attacking (PVP). On Private servers/solo play these can be turned off and some are automatically turned off, but in official servers they are unchanging. \\nNow on to pros. \\nI love how open this game is. I can do what I want, when I want, and wherever I want. If I want to build a castle on top of a mountian I can do just that. If I want to tame a T-Rex, or Quetzalcoatlus (giant flying reptile) I can simply set my sights on that and tame one. I would reccommend starting on an official PVE server and learning the ropes from the helpful sorts that tend to gather there before heading over to any PVP servers. If you start on a PVP for the first time don\\'t be surprised if players destroy your \"loot pinata\" (house built with easy to break materials like thatch and to a much lesser degree wood) for the easy and free items they can get out of the building. \\nKeep in mind this is a survival game. However, unlike some survival games ARK does not penalize you if you die. If you die and don\\'t find your equipment after a while your equipment will disapear, but everything else you have built will not (unless there was a giga attacking your base camp, even then you keep all of your level ups and engrams so it is a lot faster to rebuild.) Go into this game expecting to die. If you are not dying on a regular basis before you reach level 20-30 you are either lucky or have had help. Joining a tribe can help make it easier to stay alive, but is not necessary (I got my first character to level 70 with around 100 pets before I joined my first tribe). I am now on my fourth character (I got bored of demolishing everything on the island with my pet gigas on 3 of the prior 4 and 1 of them I accidentally deleted). \\nAlso keep in mind that this game is not yet complete. There will continue to be changes made to the game until it is officially released, so be warned that the game is not optimised (may run slow/not at all on mid cost computers), and there are going to be glitches and or things that break between now and completion. We are here testing the game to help them find game breaking bugs, so be sure to report any that occur. \\nThere are quite a few mods for this game, and many of them are great. I would however reccomend taming all the way up to at least a T-Rex before you start to mod the game. Some of the mods take away from the over all gameplay. \\nHope my review is helpful, and I wish any who play good luck. FYI Official PVE servers are probably the best starting locations for new players.',\n",
       " \"After 1070 hours in game I'm uninstalling. Devs will not listen to player base at all. The game is being killed. With every patch they add more content/bugs to a game that is already so buggy and glitchy already. FIX THE BUGS AND AI PATHING. You can't ride a land based tame without getting snagged on every little thing on the map. I've lost so many tames to these glitchy maps it's stupid. PVE is boring and ruined by the devs last patch, PVP is completely unbalanced and not real PVP at all. There is no way to defend a base on this game at all. You can try all you want but the larger tribe WILL get in.  Offensive strategies are too strong compared to the little bit of defenses available. Cross ark transfers were the first stage of the devs killing the game, the flyer nerf was the second. \\nI hope you enjoy boring farming at stupidly low rates just to watch your work be taken by somebody else while you're offline. Ark PVP servers have become toxic in a way that you can't let your kids play either. This game has a stupid amount of potential if the devs would just listen...Don't waste money on this game until it is complete and done in all aspects.

       " 'I am convinced that the Survial game genera is a big joke on us. Its a big socilogical experiment and we are the Guinea Pigs. Most of the time this game is so much fun, but then some jerk does the equivalent of Home Invasion in real life and ruins everything. They scream and shout about PvP and so on. PvP is garbage in this game. Tribe Warfare and PvP when you and your oponent are on even ground is fun. Being lvl 65 or 100 depending what you play on, and running around picking up and dropping new spawns isnt pvp, thats pretty much just going to the newborn ward at the local hospital and punching babies. Mostly its high level people and large Tribes wiping out smaller ones for some weird reason.  Alot of the interactions that go on in game are mostly people whom are very \"small\" in real life, who are a bit to big for their britches in game. (Yeah I said Britches,,whats up ?)   One of my first encounters with the lower lifeforms in this game was as I was taming a dino with  some tribe members, two people came up to us and accused us of stealing something. We didnt, and we told them that. They decided anyways to Tranq me and when I dare voice my displeasure over it, the female aggressor killed me, and said that I should be nice..... I called her a scumbag.  Oh well life goes on.\\nAnyways whole point being this game will pretty much let you live out your sociopathic fantasys of murdering people for nothing, and more than likely be stabbed to death in a dark jungle by a 15 year old.  Mostly this game is just an excuse to act crappy toward people with no reprocussions.\\nBUT :PvP can be great when things are relativly fair. Rideing dinosaurs is great, EVERYTHING about this game is awesome. EXCEPT other people, who mostly spend time griefing. Find a good server. Find a group of people, not just 1-4 guys. I mean like 15-20 people. Then the game will really shine.\\nAlso to the Toxic comments I keep Deleteing, IDGAF about you thoughts feelings or opinions. Go write your own review.

       " \"It's been over two years and 3000 hours since I first started to play ARK.  I've seen the good, and the bad, and the what the hell.  I've seen the angry folks who can't forgive any misstep, the people who bend over backwards to defend the developer, and everyone in between that just wants to play the damned game.  It's hard to talk about the game without talking about the development cycle so here's the preamble: This was an Early Access game.  It had a checkered past of being filled chock full of bugs (falling through the map when logged out, for example), running at least a year longer in development time than intended, and putting out a paid DLC expansion while still in development.  These are all things that have happened.\\nNow, with that out of the way, yes, I recommend ARK.  With caveats.  \\nQuite a few, actually.\\nYou see, what first got me here, and might be getting you here, is the notion of taming dinosaurs.  And let me tell you, I still love riding a rex and eating things.  I love having a grouping of dinos that are just . . . mine.  I grew up loving dinosaurs.  I still love them.  What kept me here is that plus building.  I love building.  It's fun to make things, giant things, pretty things, fantastic things. But, what enables these things in a way that makes them enjoyable are (A) mods.  Lots of mods.  (B) an unofficial server (C) reasonable people to play with, regardless of PvE or PvP.\\nLet's hit up the main game experience first.  You load into your chosen world, and are prompted to create your version of a dude or a lady, then, when finished, you spawn in, naked but for some undies laying somewhere on a beach or the jungle.  And then, almost immediately after, you are eaten.  You may or may not even see your attacker.  You spawn again.  This time, you get a good look around (and almost assuredly turn down your graphical settings; the game has been optimized but it's still overly demanding) and you get to see the raptor running at you before being attacked by the rest of the raptors following that one, and boom, dead again.  You spawn in a third time and, assuming you aren't on a PvP server where griefers reign, you will live.  You see a few wandering creatures, and you start picking berries from bushes so you don't starve.  Hitting trees for thatch. Picking up stones from the ground.  Now you have a stone pick, a building plan you start with, and you can start to harvest rocks.  And then a dilophosaurus spits on you, blinding you while it eats you.  You spawn in again, and once again are naked and tool-less.  You can now choose: run to your corpse to retrieve your belongings, or start anew.  Here's what you'll keep if you die: your experience, and your “engrams” building plans that you have personally memorized.  Anything and everything else can be lost.  Dinosaurs, buildings, items, anything.  If you're on PvP, the you ARE setting yourself up for potentially losing hours to days to even months of work in the possible blink of an eye.  On PvE, you only lose the items on you when you die, your dinosaurs to other dinosaurs, or structures to rampaging beasts that detect you or a tamed dino, which they apparently find super interesting and immediately tasty, and they will chew through your house to get to the meaty treat inside.  That means a sufficient wall will keep those out.  There are ways to safeguard, but the potential for loss is always there.\\nNow, on to the points. There are free official map “mods”, and the best of those, visually, is one called Ragnarok.  The original Island is fine for starting out on, but Ragnarok has a bit of everything, including a smattering of most of the things from Scorched Earth, the DLC expansion they released during development.  There are also building and decoration mods, Structures + being the most well known, so well known that Wildcard themselves have decided to implement features of that mod into the base game; it includes a variety of quality of life features that allow for easier building as well as automation of some of the more tedious farming and upkeep requirements.  There are decorative mods, the most robust being eco's series of mods.  There is a rather in depth building mod for medieval style building called Castles, Keeps, and Forts, which allows for a different style and look over the original materials.  There's even mods to speed along the taming times by causing hunger while simultaneously delivering torpor.  If all this seems like a lot to cover, it is, at first.  You may or may not be better off trying ARK in single player to test it out vanilla first, but sooner or later, you'll want a server, because this game isn't built nor balanced for single player.\\nWhen you pick servers, if you happen to be a masochist, I'd suggest choosing an official server, which will have default tame times and harvesting ratios and the whole thing will take you a while.  If you hate yourself, choose an offical PvP server.  Otherwise, I heartily suggest finding a friend, an acquaintance, or just picking at random and signing in to an unofficial server.  See, those servers can change taming times to be more reasonable.  There are dinosaurs that, without the super master taming food, can take upwards of 8 hours, depending on the level.  This is reasonable only if you have a tight knit group willing to take shifts to tend to the creature.  Even in PvE, a wandering meat eater of some kind can happen upon the unconscious dinosaur and ruin the tame.  It can be even harder/worse with “passive” tames, where you toss it food and then wait as it wanders, possibly coming in contact with all manner of dangerous creatures.  A server with altered stats for taming, harvesting, breeding, and more is in my opinion a must for full enjoyment of the game past the mark of a week.\\nWhich I feel leads me to the last point, if you join a server where there are griefers, PvE or PvP, you're gonna have a bad time.  PvP griefing is obvious, but even worse is the PvE griefer which builds items to block spawns, and then continues to check in so their built roadblocks don't decay.  You will need to find reasonable folks, regardless of your preferred playstyle (unless that playstyle is griefer, in which case, I dunno man).\\nWith those three things taken care of, the game will be a wonderful experience.  2000 of those 3000 hours I've played have been on modded, changed stat maps in PvE, and it's why I've played as long as I have. \\nAlso, as a note, though this game has offically been launched, it is still under development.  They are revamping some of their earlier creatures, putting out new DLC, and they patch it constantly. The game as-is is over 100 gigs of information on a hard drive.  You'll need several gigs more if you want mods.  It doesn't run well on low end machines, I doubt it's ever going to be optimized for them.  Also, find an active server, otherwise you're waiting on the admin to update the server for way too long.\\nHappy hunting, and tame a rex for me, survivors.\",\n",
       " 'TL;DR: Bite the bullet and pay for a private server with your buddies if you want to have any fun.\\nIn the newest trailer for ARK, a naked man awakes on a beach with no idea what the hell is going on. Seconds later, he\\'s killed by a woman riding a raptor and wielding an AK-47 simply for the crime of existing. While this was a wonderful cinematic that was meant to promote the game positively, it incidentally showed potential players the single WORST part of the game and the reason you should avoid it entirely.\\nUnless you\\'re planning on playing on a private server with friends, which will cost you at least $15 a month, you\\'re guaranteed to only enjoy playing ARK if you get incredibly lucky. And I mean -incredibly- lucky. You may even find better luck on public servers if you have a friend who\\'s got 5,000+ hours in game and can supply you with everything to get started. I\\'ve tried no less than 24 times to start fresh on public servers, and here\\'s just a sampling of the things that\\'ve happened to me:\\n- Chased down by a three men riding Tyrannosaurs because I tried harvesting fiber on \"their beach\"\\n- Tranquilized with a scoped rifle, handcuffed, siphoned for my blood and left on a raft floating in the middle of the ocean\\n- Tamed my first dinosaur, logged off for a grand total of an hour and logged back in to find both my beloved parasaur and everything I\\'d made from cloth and wood stolen, burned to the ground, etc.\\n- Tranq\\'d (again) after I logged on, regained consciousness only to find my inventory stuffed with dinosaur poop.\\n- Had my entire box of berries and (albeit stolen) eggs raided and replaced with large dinosaur poop.\\n- Finally, and I mean FINALLY got to the point where I\\'d made a friend and we\\'d built a small base together near a waterfall off of the tundra. Left for maybe 10 minutes to tame some pterosaurs so we could fly, and returned to find the server admin astride a massive bronto smashing everything we owned because \"it was his waterfall\"\\nThe community is toxic, the game actively punishes you for logging off, and no matter how much progress you make you\\'ll NEVER be guaranteed anything besides a swift and unjust end. Think you can lock your base\\'s door and log off inside to be safe? Wrong again. Someone will just bust down the wall and drag your♥♥♥♥♥outside to execute you for the crime of not playing the game 24 hours a day. \\nI had fun ONLY when I was on a private server with friends and we took the time solely to have fun and build massive cities in the wildnerness. The game HAS potential, but even now it\\'s just sadistic garbage that punishes people for trying to play the game without some kind of helping hand on their side long before they start playing.\\nEither get a friend who\\'s lost his job because of all his ARK hours, or get your own server and never deal with the community at large. Red pill or blue pill. Which will you take? It doesn\\'t matter; one\\'s cyanide and the other\\'s a placebo that\\'ll give you diarrhea.',\n",
       " \"After 1500 hours in ark, I'm willing to give a review and it's really a word of warning. Read all the other negative reviews, they aren't exaggerating. Either give up any life you had in real life Ark to play this ark, because you can't have both. When you spend hundreds of hours farming a base and taming dinos, be prepared to spend hundreds of hours maintaining that, because if you aren't constantly growing your defenses and and watching all your assets, a zerg tribe from some far off country and server will come and wipe everything you had, and not even feel a little bad about it.  And when you go to take your favorite battle Quetz loaded with Ascendant weapons and armor to seek revenge on those block lettered tribes that killed all your passive tames you spent hundreds of hours on.... It'll despawn. With the last of your precious things. And the Developers won't help get any of it back.\\nArk is a game that you can spend 18 hours on a day, and the moment you go to sleep, someone in an opposite timezone will come and take all your things. Don't sleep long, because they will spend the entire 6-8 hours you sleep tanking all your defenses, slowly sliding their way into the most intimate parts of your base, and there's nothing you can do about it.\\nIt's a cold blooded game that will destroy everything around you. If you want a life, turn around and run. Play some FPS that you can turn off and walk away from and not start over again. \\nPlease read the reviews. It's a game you will hate to love.  It's a bad kind of addicting. It's like meth or coke, you'll want to leave, but you just can't quit.\",\n",
       " \"Got killed by a brontosaurus while taming a pteranadon in the jungle at night because a T-rex attacked it. \\nCame back to find someone looting my corpse. Killed her with my fists.\\nHer boyfriend stabbed me in the back of the head. Died.\\nRespawned, re-equipped, dodge shots from my OWN GUN THAT THEY STOLE, killed boyfriend with spear to the face.\\nPunched out woman while she was screaming profanity's at me in in-game voice chat. \\nDrowned her in a river, screaming the whole time. \\nGot all my stuff back.\\nThrew a grenade into the thieves thatch hut. Boom.\\nJustice.\\n10/10 Would justice again.\\nIn all seriousness, the Official servers lack clear rules and administration. Do yourself a favor, find a good unofficial server, and the game will be loads better. No hacking, no cheaters, no lag, no rubberbanding, etc. You'll also find a better community on these servers, which is part of the fun in a game like this. \\nAs for leveling, it's quite easy, as everything you do that requires input from yourself except taming, gives you exp from 1 to 67, which is current max level. Hence, you don't have to move on to a new area, like some other games on the market. \\nThe game is harsh, however, and it does not go easy on you. If your T-rex dies, that you just spent 7 hours taming, it's dead. There's no way to bring it back, or rez it, or take backs. If you get overly attached to the things you tame, play PVE. You'll have a much more fun time, because if you play PVP, you may just log in naked on the beach with everything you own destroyed. Again, play on an unofficial with rules that you agree with. Some unofficials don't allow base leveling, or killing of passive dino's, etc. \\nYou'll want to find a tribe, because the more people you have working on a base, the stronger it will be, and the less time it will take building it. Once you get to metal tier, the sheer amount of stones you need to make a small metal building will be astonishing, so you need to work with others to accomplish goals that are out of a single players reach. \\nIf you play on a PVP server, know that at some point, you will wake up dead. It's only a matter of time before this happens. Expect it, and have a backup plan. IE: A small hidden home, preferrably metal, with supplies for retaming, rearming, retooling, etc., so that you don't have to start from a stone axe again. \\nOverall, it's an excellent experience, as long as you are OK with an EA title. You'll find bugs that will screw you over and cause you to lose tons of your time, but that's par for the course at this stage of development. \\nThere is no other survival game on the market that comes close to Ark at the moment. My playtime attests to that fact. \\nIf you pick it up, good luck on the isle! If you have questions, stop by my stream and ask away. I'm live from Morning (10 AM MST) to afternoon (3PM MST), and from evening (6-7PM MST) until late at night (1-3AM MST). On day 16 of a 30 Day streaming challenge, so 7 days a week.\",\n",

       " \"First Review...\\nTLDR; Don't plan on playing on an offical server and having a good time unless you have a crew of more than 20 to outplay Alpha clans.  Even then that's a stretch as some of these alpha clans span many servers and have over 200 members.  The most broke mechanic of all is the fact that I can name myself clan blablabla and rename it FyourFace and raid you, then change it back to blablabla and you will never know who killed your tames or raided your things.  Alphas do this all the time.  Offical servers are populated by either american, asian or brazil population and once one of them becomes an alpha if you are not from that nation you are a target.  Plain and simple\\nPlay on private, donate to private so they stay alive and stay away from offical server alphas.  they just troll and make up rules as they go.  Who's gonna stop them?\\nWhy spend 365 hours playing a game when an alpha clan can end you and ban you from a server in 10 minutes?  And that means all skills all levels gone in 10 minutes because they have the numbers to report you for abuse.  So you could join another server and start fresh, and the same thing could happen again.  \\nSo what's the problem?  Alpha clans and or large clans have nothing to do.  After they've tamed 12 Gigas and 15 Trex's and breed them to perfection stats what is there to do?  Might as well go stomping around and flex.  build metal letters in the hills that spell out clan names and kill people that want those resources for ingame stuff.  They are bored and you become their entertainment.  all your QQ and WTF's become their live streams and lolz.  \\nI loved the game, thought it was cool, built a base and started to tame and then....  I was raided so i built smarter and better, watched videos and tuts studied and played with building offline.  And was never raided (most raiding happens by mid teir clans that rename themselves so they don't get caught.) but no...   IRON MAIDEN the alpha clan said FU when I ask them to stop picking on small 2 man clans.   I myself was a one man clan.  365 hours playing on one sever to have IRON MAIDEN an alpha clan on many different servers with 200 some members most being  brazil, come out, blow my stuff up, knock me out and  imprison me.  What am I do to?  beg? They are more equiped and established then anyone on the server combined.   No I start spamming on global F#@* IRON MAIDEN AND EVERY SERVER THEY'RE ON.  STOP.  Think about it.  You're not getting your stuff back, they're not letting you out of your cage, your only option is to die of starvation and respawn.  At which point your base is already gone and your tames and your gear and for what?  You ask them to stop picking on small clans and they grab you!  well the global spam lasted for about 10 minutes and now I can't join the server no more.\\n  \\nSo!  you can join an alpha clan or hope to start one and troll the hell out of that server but the moment you feel trolled and decide to troll back... Ban hammer from that server.  ALPHAS have no end game other than to fake police or monitor the server how they choose.  so this game is at the mercy of whom ever is the alpha.  And you might be thinking well that's life and that's how it's supposed to be.  Let me say this Alpha clans are not alpha clans becuase they are better at the game they are alpha because they had a head start on a server and killed off anyone and kill anyone that gets close to them in supplies and basses to eliminate threat.  Legit strat?  sure.  So again if you have a large clan and want to try and troll a server then by all means i hope you enjoy the game.  Otherwise when you start building smart large or defensive you become target number one.  \\nSurvival is one thing first come first serve is another.\\nYou will get wiped if large enough, strong enough and or creative enough to become a threat at low levels by either leading a gigantor to your base, doing it themselves, or renaming the clan to wipe you so that when you look at the logs you have no clue who did it.\",\n",
       " \"After 788 hours on this game I can say I loved it until they added tek crap. After that it went down hill from there. Game is still not optimized, a lot of bugs and exploits still exist. The devs seemed to stop caring about it and switched to adding stuff that not many people care for anymore. I will say, I got my money's worth on it ,but its not the game it once was.\",\n",
       " 'TL;DR - the developers are making an absurd mockery of both this game and the entire Early Access program\\nFirst a couple of (in)sanity checks: this game was released almost two years ago. Then a little over half a year ago an expansion DLC was released, with a price tag roughly 60% of what the base game is selling for. That expansion consisted of an entirely NEW world to explore, with new dinosaurs, new technologies...basically a whole new game that just had the same engine and mostly the same rules and mechanics. And still they hide behind the Early Access program instead of admitting this game stopped being \"Early\" a long, long time ago. OK, end of rant about the absurdity of calling this an Early Access title.\\nNow to cases. Here is what the game does well (evaluating only the base game, not the paid DLC):\\n1. Great concept, survival plus team play plus dinosaurs. A wonderful way to start.\\n2. Excellent world design, in graphics, diversity, and habitability.\\n3. Very fun dinosaur taming mechanics (for the most part). \\n4. Solid building mechanics, enabling everything from rude huts to massive cliffside fortresses.\\nAll in all a nearly perfect start on creating a Game of the Century quality release. Now here is where it goes off the rails and dashes any such hopes:\\n1. A thoroughly toxic community, with absolutely no built in measures to stop the trolls and other toxic player types from actively ruining the gaming experience for virtually everyone else, even on PVE servers. Even on servers with mostly good players, and there certainly are some of those, only a few trolls and malicious players can quickly ruin things for everyone except the long-term, well established teams that have been on the server for ages, who only hold their own by measures almost as toxic to the server at large as the creeps they are defending themselves from. New players don\\'t have a prayer, of course. Example, all efforts to stop established players from gobbling up all the buildable land in sight have been utter failures, and one or two attempts actively made the problem much worse, so that new players can scarcely find a place to even build a campfire, let alone a shelfter from the beasties and then eventually a home. \\n2. An update system that has an annoyingly prevalent tendency to break things, e.g. by ejecting your tamed dinos from their pens, by teleporting killer dinos inside your premises, etc. And they run updates far too often and for far too little reason. Apparently it never occurred to the devs to save up and alpha test new changes until they are both a) known to be at least as sound as the code currently running, and b) there are enough of them to bother doing an update at all. And of course premature updates then result in multiple hotfix updates to fix the problems introduced in previous updates. It is almost as bad as Microsoft Windows, where most of the bug fixes in each new update are there to fix bugs introduced in previous updates. And yet all those updates consistently FAIL to fix any of the serious bugs, some of which have been in the game since the very beginning.\\n3. After probably hundreds of incremental updates, the devs still haven\\'t figured out how to make solid objects....solid. Dinos get stuck inside walls. Objects and players sink through floors and often the ground beneath them, becoming stuck and/or irretrievable. Tamed dinos blink out of existence entirely, only to appear minutes to hours later in places they cannot survive more than moments, like in the middle of a swamp full of hungry wild dinos...or hundreds of feet up in midair. Ravenous wild dinosaurs pass right through even giant steel walls to feast on your tamed dinos inside. Players fall out of the sky when their flying mounts suddenly become momentarily insubstantial or when the game knocks them offline because of even the briefest interruption of one\\'s connection to the game server, which is often the result of....\\n4. ....crappy and highly inconsistent server performance, with very poor optimization and almost no safeguards against lag and other connection issues.\\nPut all that together and the real problem becomes blindingly obvious: the devs are too caught up adding new content, e.g. a progression of more and more dangerous dinos, new items, harder survival modes, etc. and totally failing to finish fixing the massive flaws in the existing content to bring this game up to anything even approaching the quality level of a final release. That is why it is perpetually stuck in \"Early Access\".\\nEdited to add one final note: I neglected to mention that the single-player of this game is actually decent, though it is still pretty gimped due to much of the content being dependent on team play to either be possible or to be enjoyable. I wouldn\\'t recommend buying the game just for the single player mode, but thought it fair to point out that a few of the worst problems, like the toxic communities, bad server performance, and poor PvE implementation are not present in SP mode, and some others are mititaged.',\n",

       " 'Warframe, my go-to grinding game, is a complex and cooperative free to play third person shooter experience enhanced by an enormous sci-fi world that has been ever expanding since it’s beta in 2013. Digital Extremes have been constantly updating and polishing the game while adding new things every single month since it’s official “release”. Yes, it’s hella time consuming, but the good kind of consuming, it’s actually enjoyable and engaging.\\n \\nAs with all of my reviews, these are my own opinions and experiences; please check out other reviews too!\\n \\nWhile Warframe has a tutorial, it is not nearly sufficient enough for the insane complexity. It teaches you basic stuff about combat and movement, and then you are basically thrown out of the nest. Sure, there is the ingame codex that tells you all kinds things but the wiki/wiki threads will always be your best friend while playing Warframe. Many aspects have to be learned and discovered by yourself which can lead to a lot of new players quitting the game early since they can’t figure out what to do or where to go. You often have to keep the wiki open in the background since there is just that much information to the game.\\n \\nDigital Extremes are in my opinion one of the best developers out there. They communicate with their community and listen to feedback. But even despite that, Warframe suffers from feature creep and old additions to the game that just feel left behind. Great concepts like archwings, raids, PVP or the glorious void fall flat compared to the rest of the game since they get boring pretty fast or just feel unpolished and there haven’t been many updates to them in ages. Additionally, most weapons and mods are just weak compared to other, better versions rendering them either useless or only good if you get a good riven mod for them.\\n \\nRiven mods help to counter the weapon feature creep if you would be able to get them more frequently but unfortunately you only get them from daily missions, warframes daily quests, or other players. These are weapon enhancement mods for a random weapon with random stats, dropped randomly as a reward from said missions. The chance to get one of these is already very small but then you have to get the right mod for the right weapon with the right stats. While stats can be rerolled, most rivens will end up sitting in your inventory forever unless you turn them into endo, sell them, or find a player who is willing to spend some platinum on it.\\n \\nEach faction has its own tilesets which are randomly put together at the beginning of each mission making it less repetitive than it would be otherwise. Each area of the solar system is controlled by a different faction and some of them even by two while the whole galaxy seems to be at war which each other. Enemies look original and well fleshed out and there is a big variety of them present in each faction while all of them have uniquely themed bosses.\\n \\nWarframe offers an overwhelming variety of enemies, locations, weapons and warframes each with their own unique style and charm. It’s easy to get lost in all this and apart from some story quests, it’s really up to the player how he wants to spend his time in this game since Warframe won’t give you any goals, you simply have to set your own, there is no real endgame. Want to be the best looking warframe? Collect all the weapons/warframes/mods? Reach the currently highest Master Rating? Create one of the biggest Clans ever? The possibilities are vast and that is what’s so captivating about this game.\\n \\nObviously, warframe is pretty grind-heavy and can feel pretty tiring at some points. Why is warframe so enjoyable though? First and foremost because of the excellent polish and design in general but also because of its fantastic movement system which features wall-running, double jumping, sliding and more that really help in making you feel like a ninja in space. The shooting is just so refined and precise while different damage and enemy types force you to switch weapons and warframes accordingly based on your next mission. Many different mission types like extermination, spy, defense, and many more ensure that no warframe is truly useless. If you should get bored with your current setup, try recommended builds for warframes and weapons or simply create your own. Augments can help a great deal with this since they can basically enhance your abilities or change how they work, resulting in a different playstyle.\\n \\nCrafting is done similarly to other games where you just get everything and craft it, only in this case you have to wait several hours and for some things even one to three days, but it is fine if you keep building other stuff in the meantime so you get a chain going. Trade missing blueprints from other players or sell your duplicates to them and earn platinum, the premium currency, and use it to upgrade your maximum number of slots, buy weapons/warframes directly of the market or just get some beautiful fashion for your warframe, the business model is just great. But be aware, the number of trades per day is tied to your mastery rating.\\nYes, Warframe is free to play but does that mean that this is hurting it? Not at all, since it is using a very fair business model. Almost all of the things you can buy with the premium currency, platinum, can be farmed without spending any money. Earning this premium currency is rather easy since you are able to trade almost anything with other players and platinum is no exception. Of course, buying things directly from the market is much faster but getting them without spending anything is not only cheaper but also a rewarding experience.\\n \\nWhile Warframe certainly can’t be called high end in terms of graphics, it’s making excellent use of it’s engine and is very slick and clean looking as a result of that. However, the game wouldn’t even look half as good as it can be if one would turn down everything to the lowest settings. Shaders and reflections as well as many other little things add up to create an experience that is not only pleasing to the eye but one that can also stand up to today’s AAA games.\\n \\nBecause of its nature, story is mostly told through quests which there are 20 of. While a handful of them are interesting and make you want to learn more about this universe, most of them are just a series of regular missions with special voice lines and objectives tagged on to it. Sure, there are bits and pieces everywhere in Warframe’s world, but people who are craving for more lore have to utilize wikis and forums to get the whole picture.\\n \\nWarframe’s soundtrack can be astonishingly good at times but being as grindy as it is, most of the songs will sadly fall short in the long term or will get boring to listen to if you hear the same ones over and over again. Otherwise the soundtrack just fits perfectly and some songs even make use of voice which fits for every situation and almost all of the different tilesets have their own songs which fit each of the different factions greatly.\\n \\n \\n \\nBesides it’s fair free to play business model, it offers a huge variety of weapons and warframes and just everything else really but it als offers an insane amount of freedom that is rarely seen in games today. I recommend this gem to anyone who enjoys third person shooters with focus on cooperation or people who are just looking for a grindy experience to pass some time and have fun while doing it.',\n",

       " 'At last, after putting 6k+ hours into this game over a 1.5 year period, one month after quitting, I am writing the review of Ark.\\nI am not going to get deep into how amazing certain aspects of this game are because most people already covered it: yes, the breeding is great and so is the building, the pve aspect, the underwater, the end-game, the maps, the graphics.\\nBut I would like to highlight a few aspects that make me NOT recommend this game unless you are going to play in single player (warning: everything Im about to point out relates to official PvE servers, and TheIsland and SE maps, from a one-person tribe, and some of these things apply to multi-person tribes too):\\n*Maintenance:\\n   - You need to put ridiculous effort into \"imprinting\" baby dinos to permanently raise their stats and make them better (meaning: you have to wake up every 3-4hrs for even up to 12 days straight, as the imprints have such intervals)\\n- You need to log in every 3 or so days to keep the most useful dinos in the game fed (quetzals and gigas), which also requieres farming food for them regularly and replenishing generator with fuel so that the fridges are working\\n   - You need to log in every 5 days to keep your glass structures from auto-decaying (and they are crucial to owning a garden or... having a really cool-looking base)\\n   - You need to log in every 7 days to keep all your dinos from expiring and people claiming them or the dinos just disappear\\n- Once you quit or take a break - due to whatever reason, whether your IRL circumstances forced you to or you just needed it - you basically loose everything you worked for, months or even years, unless you trust somebody else enough to let them take over. The only thing you do not loose is your character (unless you left it on a server that had a random shut down and never got back online - and yes, that happens to official servers too, like server 89.)\\n*Optimization:\\n   - The game lags horribly and freezes in areas where people build big, fully enclosed bases and have a lot of dinos. It can freeze even for 1-2 minutes and could possibly crash too. Then you, say, fall off your bird, your character gets eaten by a wild dino and your bird gets killed by it too.\\n*The game is only for people who have a lot of free time:\\n   - Breeding (without an event that boosts the raising rates) is horribly time consuming... 28hrs for a baby giga? Where you have to hand-feed it every few minutes or it dies? Really?\\n   - Transferring of items between the servers - you can only transfer what you put into your inventory in last 30mins, and once that timer is up, you need to wait another 30 minutes, standing by an obelisk (or tek transmitter if you have one), praying that no wild dino will attack you, that you won\\'t die of cold etc. Very horrible for trading because transferring stacks of metal now takes hours, just for the sake of one dino or blueprint.\\n*Lack of logical solutions and balance:\\n   - End-game is actually not all that fun. They keep \"re-balancing\" the bosses and the ascension, half the time making it impossible to beat it. In the beginning of summer 2017, they made such changes that killing dragon, ape or brood on hard level was almost impossible - and with the dragon, it actually was impossible. No matter how many generations of rexes you must breed and trade for, and imprint, and no matter how good gear you get, it never is enough. The game lacks balanced end-game features that would be achievable through challenges that are possible to complete but do not require glitches or exploits to do that. \\n   - I\\'ve seen changes that made many people quit or be outraged... take the flyer\\'s nerf, where they crippled the whole group of dinos, believing that they were too overpowered, just because they could transport you quickly from one part of the map to the other... I\\'ve seen developers abusing the exploits themselves that they would normally condemn people for: they would put their baby dinos in water in order to keep them in stasis so they didn\\'t need to be fed... Before the game left the early development, its price already jumped from like 20$ to 60-70$? While it still had bugs and badly required fixes and completion (the final boss was not implemented yet).\\n    - Servers being full, player-wise (70/70 players at a time) and dino-wise (5k dinos per server), making it impossible to breed and tame.\\n   - Most changes are for new players, not veteran players.\\nAnd leaving the worst thing yet for the end... Deceit. Developers deceived people. How? Well, let\\'s take a look. Firstly, they promised us all that they would not wipe the official servers upon the game release (which happened somewhere at the beginning of September 2017 I believe), then they said that they would actually do the wipe. And then, when they got a very big outrage from the players, they said that they would split the servers into two: part would be \"Legacy\" and that\\'s where the players who played Ark for 2 years before it left early access would be, and \"the New\" servers, that had no connection to Legacy and were a fresh start for anyone who wanted to do so especially in PvP. \\nThey said they wouldn\\'t wipe the servers... but then they made a list of \"only the barren, ghost-towns\" servers to shut down and repurpose them for the new cluster.... but from just a \"chunk\", it was almost half of all servers. Players had only FIVE days to move from their server (if it was on the kill-off list\") to a different one. 500 dinos, tons of heavy materials, lots of blueprints, fertilised eggs, their water dinos... For most, it was impossible to do a complete move, so some quit completely, and the rest had to give up at least a part of what they had since they coulnd\\'t transfer it all in such a short period of time.\\nAnd then, when everyone settled and thought that the stress is gone... The developers announced that every 3 months, they will be wiping 10% of Legacy servers (\"the bottom ones\", least populated ones) to repurpose them for the New servers... until all Legacy is gone. That being said, ultimately they WILL wipe the Legacy, going against everything they promised to their players, it\\'s just that they will do it over time. And who would want to invest their time, knowing that in the next series of shut-downs, their server might land on the kill-off list? Not many people. That\\'s why most of them either quit, or moved to the New servers (which, by the way, are getting pretty full too).\\nI do not recommend it. Especially not for the current price. At the beginning, the game might be wonderful. But in long-term, especially towards the end-game where the grind is your new daily routine, it gets frustrating. The decay system is horribly punishing, and unofficial servers have it too, because they don\\'t want their maps to be full of bases yet nobody being online, and none of those things being utilized. The developers are not trustworthy with their words and promises, which in the end could cost somebody a lot of emotional stress and feeling of utter defeat, when your years-worth of work goes to hell. Furthermore, it is not good for people who don\\'t have much time. Playing only on the weekends won\\'t just be enough for official servers. It could be for single-player or unofficial servers, but that\\'s about it.\\nI ultimately quit because I had to spent 4 days in hospital, just after the game left early access, and came back to some of my dinos dead from starvation and structures auto-decayed. Then my university started and I understood that my priorities should shift from spending all evenings and some nights on this game, especially knowing that if for some reason I don\\'t manage to log in for a few days, I would loose it all, to focusing on my health and education. There are other, way better survival games out there that are not so high-maintenance but also fun to play - and many of them I would recommend over Ark any day. Just do yourself a favor and do not buy this game.',\n",

I\\'ve had a lot of fun in my almost 2000 hours on this game. I\\'ve died many, MANY times, I\\'ve lost my stuff and dinos many times and got angry at the game, but in the end I still love the game. Now that I look back at my past in this game, I remember how much fun all of those adventures actually were and all those losses were actually useful; it\\'s like real life, you learn from your mistakes. \\nSo buy ARK, be part of the community.

Those aspects of the game are now being resold to us as PAID DLC.  Meaning they are double dipping charging us again for the same promised content.  Technically speaking yes it could still be released at a later date into the core game, however the point is they released this FIRST before finishing the main game.  Also this next point is two sided.  Its great they DO LISTEN to modders and even take those mods and incorporate them into the game.  However the problem is when they take those idea then put them into a paid DLC that has similar features of free mods out there.  This ties into the below qoute from a Wild Card Employee, many of those free \"dlc\" started as community ideas or mods.  Example:  The Center Map\\n3.  The general attitude of employees of Wild Card.  Examples(unverified): \\n\"We don\\'t want to charge players more than we have to,\" he said. \"That\\'s why we give away a lot of free DLC.

Moderators of the ARK community trying to silence protesters of this madness by creating one single mega thread with a nuetral title to appear there is no outrage or issue with doing this.  \\n6.

No one disputes the core game is solid and worth the money.

       " 'Souce IGN reviews and my own thoughs\\nIn the distant future of Warframe, you are a space ninja who has woken from a long slumber to find the solar system in disarray. Armed with a variety of exciting powers, you must fight an army of decaying clones, tech-minded science jerks, mutant freaks and other awesome enemies. The entire game is free to play, but it’s so good that I spent a hundred bucks on it and don’t regret a cent.\\nFor me, it’s a point of pride that I don’t spend money on free to play games. Spending money means giving in to systems designed to manipulate me; it feels like losing. That constant reminder on players to buy, buy, buy is like a movie theatre interrupting a movie every few seconds to remind people that they can buy popcorn and soda any time they’d like. Not giving in to the ads feels like winning against an intrusive and unpleasant experience.\\nDigital Extremes’ Warframe is different–different enough that I actually bought Prime Access and some platinum. In all, I’ve spent about $100 on the game, something I’ve never done for a free to play game before. I felt like Warframe was worth it.\\nYou don’t have to pay, though, and the game does not constantly dangle the option to pay in your face. The only reminders that you should spend money are located deep within customization menus or in the store, which is a console in your ship that you can easily ignore.\\nWarframe doesn’t care about balance. You’re a badass space ninja, after all! ... What’s great about being overpowered is that, since everyone is overpowered, no one is.\\nThe multiplatform free-to-play game is an action shooter with some of the trappings of an MMO. It launched in 2013 and is available now on PC, PS4 and Xbox One, where it is regularly updated. As a recently-awoken space ninja called a Tenno, your job is to fly around the solar system doing space ninja stuff like assassinations, spying on people, stealing information, and performing sabotage. Each mission location and type remains the same, but the missions themselves are somewhat randomized. The game relies on a random tile system to keep things fresh. Your base of operations–and your main menu–is your ship.\\nWhen you log in, you’re sitting in front of your command console, which lets you select where you want to go in the solar system. To your right is the store. To your left is the codex. Behind you, deeper in the ship, are other stations, like the foundry that lets you build weapons or the armory that allows you to outfit and modify your frames.\\nAh, right, frames. The eponymous warframes operate like character classes, except instead of being locked into one class per character, you can swap frames at will, with each frame having four unique powers. For one mission, you might feel like running the supportive frame Trinity, who can mass heal the entire team or provide energy vampire abilities to ensure quick regeneration. On the next mission, you might want to play as Ember, whose incredible World on Fire ability burns every enemy within a massive radius.\\nYou obtain warframes by defeating bosses and getting their parts or by completing some of the game’s great quests. Warframes are not just some cool gimmick or branding idea, but a cool design choice. Two good ideas make them great: first, they’re all overpowered, and second, you have to hunt them down.\\nWarframe doesn’t care about balance. You’re a badass space ninja, after all! Rather than pushing players through a lengthy and meaningless grind, Warframe provides players tons of awesome and incredibly destructive powers. I love running Frost, a frame that launches a massive blast of ice, freezing everything around it, killing most low-level enemies. Playing like Frost feels like running around as a tactical nuke. The sheer destructive power being wielded is awe-inspiring, but that’s true of every frame. Valkyr’s power is invulnerability. It comes at the expense of ranged weapons, but that’s fine, because as a space ninja, your swords are just as cool, if not cooler, than your guns.\\nWhat’s great about being overpowered is that, since everyone is overpowered, no one is. The power you wield makes you feel like you’re actually a badass space ninja, because you’re killing lots of enemies quickly and efficiently. Other sci-fi games, like Mass Effect 2, force you into cover through a lack of health and a focus on small groups of enemies. There’s no sense of lethality or badassery going on when your character feels like they’re made of soggy toilet paper while enemies can last through an entire magazine of gunfire. Warframe understands this, so every frame feels fun to play, because every frame has powerful, over-the-top capabilities.\\nA friend of mine recently picked up one of the harder-to-obtain warframes, Ivara. He didn’t like her at first, until he realized that, among other things, he could use her abilities to create ziplines anywhere on the map. Ivara drastically altered his mobility and our fireteam’s damage capabilities, allowing us to breeze through content that had previously been too challenging.\\nI’ve played a lot of games over the years, and it seems like most developers’ idea of balance is that everything should feel equally underpowered. The player generally has to play with caution, staying back, even occasionally bunching up, letting enemies come to them as they cheese their way through fights. Warframe’s “you should feel like a ninja” approach encourages more proactive players who slice, dice, and explode their way through hundreds of enemies. I’ve seen builds that kill every enemy on the field at a given time. I’ve watched players one-hit kill a boss and continue onwards as if nothing happened. Warframe’s lethality doesn’t just make you feel effective. It gets you through content quickly, too.\\nMost online games require massive amounts of player time but lack sufficient content to actually demand that time. They rely on heavy amounts of repetition and luck. Players have to play a lot to get a little. Warframe instead allows you to pass through content quickly and always guarantees something interesting at the end of the journey.\\nAs a ninja, you can “bullet jump” through most of the maps. Bullet jumping is a way to bypass lots of enemies by zipping past most enemies faster than they can respond. This means that you can get through missions quickly. That works well with another of the game’s better-implemented elements: timed content. Every few minutes, a new challenge pops up. Sometimes, the reward is credits. Other times, it’s crafting materials. I follow a Twitter feed that alerts me any time a blueprint is available. Combined with the speed at which I can complete content, I can catch a Twitter alert, pop into the game, grab the loot I want, and get back to whatever I was doing without a problem.\\nI recently got an alert for an item I wanted, logged in, played through the mission, and obtained the item within about 10 minutes. The result is a game that can be played in brief 10 to 15 minute spurts, as opposed to a game like The Division, which has a tiny handful of missions that require daily grinding if you want to be able to get enough credits to buy good gear.\\nWarframe’s speed means that it doesn’t doesn’t demand your commitment, but if you’re looking for something more in your relationship, the game’s got you covered.\\nA traditional loot game sends you into an encounter with the expectation of randomized loot. Take Borderlands, for instance. The game claims to have about 87 bazillion guns, but how many of those are meaningful or interesting guns? Most of the guns I’ve encountered in the Borderlands series are samey, even unremarkable, with the exception of a few gag guns. The same is true of The Division; I can’t tell you how many Vectors I’ve located, but I can tell you that they all play the same, just doing more or less damage depending on their stats.\\nI wish more games were like Warframe.',\n",

       " ' It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had. \\nThe premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you\\'ll need to grind.\\nMultiple new game modes exist, including \"Invasion\", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission.\\nThe latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game\\'s melee combat.\\nThe most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy.\\nIn conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new \"EVE Online\"-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard.\\n<hr>\\nA great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole.\\nWarframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. \\nGameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game\\'s metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. \\nWeapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character.\\nSo far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a \"community effort\" in which everyone can participate.\\nThe only \"issue\" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it\\'s a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games \"premium\" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. \\nThe game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its \"free to play\" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you\\'re willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It\\'s always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds.\\nUltimately, if you\\'re just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.',\n",

You start with 2 character slots, 6 weapon slots and 50 plat, 20 plat can get you a character slot and 12 plat can get you 2 weapon slots. You'll pretty much want to spend this 50 plat on slots, as everything else is a waste. Getting more plat costs money and I highly recommend that if you want to spend some money on plat, log into the game every day and wait for the 75% discount to show up. With the discount, a one time purchase of about 1000 plat should set you up for life if all you buy is slots and you don't care about having all the weapons. If you want to collect ALL the weapons, you'll probably want to spend $50 and go for the 3000 plat option.\\nThe mod grind (collecting thingies to improve your stats and the stats of your weapons) can take a stinking long time to work through, but if you can have fun doing it (after all, it just means playing the game a lot), you'll be rewarded with weapons that feel like they do more than tickle the enemies you fire them at.\\nGood mods and good weapons are required if you want to be more than a leech on the later planets, but everyone's usually blasting through the missions so fast that they hardly notice if you lag behind and die horribly to the handful of enemies they overlooked.\\nI'd say the biggest problem this game has is a lack of reasons for veterans to return to old content. It can be really difficult to get a group for that one mission you need to unlock the other mission you need to unlock the mission that unlocks the next planet you want to get to to work your way towards that boss that drops the parts you need to make the warframe (class) you wanted a week ago and still haven't reached.\\nPlaying with friends is recommended.\",\n",
       " \"Hi There!\\nI've put around 450 hours into ARK: Survival Evolved which, compared to many reviews, isn't a huge amount. In this time, however, I've played on both PVP and PVE servers and had a go at hosting a server of my own.\\nWhen I first bought ARK I quit the game after 2 minutes and didn't return to it for months. My PC isn't a beast, but it plays all the games I own at a decent Frames Per Second with good settings. I was absolutely astounded, however, when I could barely hit 10 FPS on the lowest of settings. It was completely unplayable and a great deal of the community had the same problem. A few months later and the developers have patched and updated the game so much that, with a few 'launch parameters', I can play this game at around 50 FPS with good settings. This game IS demanding, but I would think negatively towards anyone who doesn't recommend this game based on it's performance. It's come along way already - think how much further it can be optimised!\\nBut most people know about the performance issues and if YOU didn't know about them before this, I suggest you read into it on the forums etc. to make sure you'll be happy with the game you purchase. Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, let's talk about the gameplay!\\nThe first server I joined was an Official PVP server. This means that the gather rate, XP gain, taming speed etc. was all at standard speed (x1). If you're new to the game, or you've only played on x1 servers this may not seem that bad, but trust me, it gets VERY tedious, VERY quickly. You could end up having to babysit an unconscious T-Rex for hours upon hours while it tames, only for it to get killed in a raid or PVP fight in minutes. If you have the time and patience, then please be my guest.\\nNow, if all the servers had these settings and the modding community wasn't as great as it is, I would have probably never played this game again. Instead, you can find a plethora of servers packed with mods and custom settings that, in my opinion, REALLY bring the game to life! Some servers are a little bit silly, being about to tame an extremely high level Bronto in 2 mins for example, but if that's your cup of tea, don't let anyone stop you!\\nThe aforementioned mods are numerous and varied, ranging from new content such as advanced machinery, to level changing scripts that make wild dinos stronger and even total coversion mods that change the whole game so you're either a pirate or stuck permanently in 'cave-man mode'.\\nI for one, will never be able to go back to a vanilla (un-modded) server with x1 settings. It's too much of a chore. If you're hesitant about wether you'll be able to put up with it too, check the Steam Workshop and you'll see what I mean. Check YouTube too. There are many famous youtubers with daily episodes.\\nI purposely have avoided detailed descriptions of things you can do in this game because I think it's more fun to explore them yourself. Besides, there are many reviews with that kind of info already.\\nI hope this review helped at least some what! \\n-XCAL\",\n",

Yeah, another convoluted grind for the sole purpose of making grinding easier.\\nDinosaurs are LITERALLY all about sitting afk beside the dinosaurs bosy wasting your time so you might grind quicker later on, provided of course the stupid ♥♥♥♥ doesnt die within the first 9 minutes of being tamed, and provided you can find ONE person on a 50 man server who is not a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥rag to make a saddle for you.\\nIf you are an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing idiot (or masochist, or a chinese gold grinder) then the official servers with the extremely stupid low gather rates, low experience rates and MASSIVE tame timers (For some of the bigger dinosaurs be prepared to sit there ALL ♥♥♥♥ING SAY, only to have one of the other 48 members of the server who ARE♥♥♥♥♥♥rags come and kill your dinosaur mere minutes before its even tamed) would be perfect, WOULD be perfect, if the developers hadnt allowed cross server transfers. \\nSince cross server transfers have been possible, the community have witnessed what can onlyt be known as some form of \"Burning Legion\" where the communists of Russia and China emegrate FULL tribes of people who are level capped with END GAME gear to a server, ransack the server, destroy all player made structures, kill all player tamed dinosaurs then leave. If you are still an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing reject, then by all means play on the official servers, but be warned, you WILL have to bow before Sargeras and suck some commie♥♥♥♥♥♥\\nIf you are NOT the aforementioned idiot, you will obviously be more drawn towards the private servers. The private servers have increased gather and experience rates and dinosaurs will tame quicker. Sounds great, but wise men teach us that if it sounds to good to be true, it usually is. Although your grind wont be as mind numbingly painful to the point you will be mining stone with your forehead irl, you are going to have to deal with the denizens of a private server. These people are literally the swathes of humanity that have never developed real social skills and will in turn try and grief you at every single chance they get since the world seemingly owes them a favour. You can spend literally hours looking for a good private server, and all you are really looking for is which server has the least amount of Downs Syndrome. \\nTLDR: Nope. Just read the ♥♥♥♥ing review,♥♥♥♥♥♥',\n",
       " 'I will try to make a review that potential buyers of this game will understand. \\nTLDR: Dont buy the game unless you\\'re prepared to dedicate your life to it completely and accept it for all of its flaws.\\n1) THERE IS NO ROOM FOR CASUAL PLAYERS.\\nIf you think you\\'re gonna go into Ark for about 2 or 3 hours, have a good time, live your life normally and pick up where you left off tomorrow, then boy i hope you like receiving a daily dose of anal pounding. Most of the fun stuff they advertise - taming dinos, exploring the map, hunting, breeding, - come second only to defending what you own. Because ARK has no safe zones, everything you acquire in the game has to be stored in areas you yourself have established. Other players who are more active than you WILL destroy your base.\\n2) PVE IS NOT A REALISTIC OPTION. \\nThere are PVE only servers in the game, but literally ALL of them have already been claimed by someone and they have gone out of their way to block all the good spots on the map. Even the spawn points where noobs come in for the first time are all blocked with structures. And since the server is PVE, the game wont allow you to destroy any of the offending structures other players have built, even if it\\'s a straw hut right on top of a spawn point. You might be thinking, \"So go PVP servers and play better then, you noob!\" Well...\\n2) PVP WANTS YOU TO SELL YOUR SOUL TO THE GAME. \\nWinning PVP is not skill based. Whoever dedicates more hours will have more ammo and more dinos and will win every single time. The game requires your tribe to be online 24/7 if you don\\'t want to lose ALL of your progress. That is not an exaggeration. Apart from your character\\'s level, you will lose EVERYTHING if you so much as take a break to study for exams, or talk to your children, or get hospitalized for playing videogames too much because...\\n3) YOU MUST COMPETE WITH THE ENTIRE PLANET. \\nBefore the recent updates, you only had to out-produce the 50 or so people on your server. But now the devs have made it possible for other players from any official server to transfer their high level characters, dinos and items to any other official server. (Note that un-official servers are immune to this but they are unreliable. They will get deleted if the owner stops paying for the rent) This means that megatribes with hundreds of active members can very easily transfer in and reduce your smaller, more casual tribe into a long, greasy underwear stain. \\nIf you and your buddies are casual gamers you either have to be slaves to a megatribe, become a megatribe yourselves or be naked, homeless dudes running around punching trees. There is absolutely no middle ground. Okay... so let\\'s be naked dudes!\\n4) BECOMING A HOMELESS RAIDER IS THE ONLY CASUAL GAME EXPERIENCE TO BE HAD. AND IT SUCKS.\\nBe a nomad, own nothing, build nothing, just come in and destroy people\\'s belongings for the lols. Nothing to lose, so you can log out and play whenever you want. That\\'s one way to play, I suppose. But the problem with that is that you can only really raid, or more appropriately \"grief\" low level players. And if that\\'s how you get your rocks off, then I hope you choke on a♥♥♥♥♥♥ But bigger tribes are basically immune to anything small time raiders with no base can dish out. You\\'ll never get to do anything else, like exploring caves or taming large dinosaurs. And once you are a known griefer in your server, big tribes will probably blow up all your structures on sight. All you can do is grief noobs into quitting the game. \\nThere was a time where ARK allowed for making friends with people on your server and establishing alliances. But these days, the devs are making a lot of changes that discourages you from that. And that is why...\\n5) HIGH LEVEL PLAYERS HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BE COMPLETE D-BAGS TO NOOBS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. \\nBecause anyone from anywhere in the world can now just come in to your backyard with unlimited resources and completely wipe your entire server, security has become a critical issue for powerful but otherwise peaceful tribes. Some random guy can simply create a new character in the server he wants to invade, set up an outpost and unload their powerful gear. \\nAlliances with other tribes could potentially make matters worse. Allied players can come over to your base and your automated defenses will not harm them. This doesnt stop them from planting C4 though... So any invader can come in, pretend to be nice, join one of your allied tribes and you wouldnt be the wiser. He can then just come over to your base and plant bombs on your gate while he says hi to the T-rex that\\'s supposed to be guarding it. And since you have no control over who other tribes recruit, nor can you ask them to pay for any damage they cause, you\\'re better off not allying with noob tribes at all.\\nUnfortunately the only way for established players to truly secure their server from invaders is to not trust anyone. Any noob that tries to come in has to be killed, no questions asked. Even worse, some tribes have now resorted to lining spawn points with defenses to kill anyone trying to enter the server. And as for your already established bases, you will need defenses built en masse if you dont want them destroyed. Which leads to my next point...\\n6) THE END GAME IS 90% GRINDING FOR RESOURCES. \\nBecause of the relentless, global-scale PVP, you need defenses on every side and corner of your base. And that requires literally all of your time grinding non-stop for resources to build and replenish the mass amounts of turrets and bullets needed to repel the inevitable arrival of hostile megatribes, who they themselves are producing at a far greater rate from the safety of their own servers. You may repel them at first. But they will come in waves. Endlessly. At anytime. So for you to survive, it\\'s producing turrets and bullets forever. No fun exploration or hunting... just mining metal and making godamn bullets. If you want to grind resources and build towers, you\\'re better off playing Clash of Clans. But even if you somehow accomplish this, it still doesn\\'t make you safe because...\\n7) THE GAME ITSELF IS FULL OF GLITCHES AND EXPLOITS.\\nIt\\'s bad enough that other players want you dead, but the game itself is actually a much bigger annoyance. Wild dinosaurs can spawn inside your most secure buildings for no apparent reason and destroy your most valuable items/furnitures/dinos before your turrets can have a chance to react. Even your own dinos can literally vanish because the game simply deleted them from the server. You can be in the middle of a heated battle on your most hard-earned dinosaur only for the game to crash, and 5 mins later you come back and you and your dino are already dead. Experienced raiders can even use the game\\'s plethora of exploits to their advantage- turrets not shooting when you carry a dodo with you, or phasing through walls, or creating 2nd accounts to farm resources. You could do everything right and still lose because the game is simply so glitchy. But maybe you\\'re thinking that this is early access, and bugs will be fixed soon? Nope.\\n8) DEVS COULDNT GIVE A SINGLE ♥♥♥♥ ABOUT GAMEPLAY. \\nWildcard is a very small development team that makes money from purchases. Not subscriptions or microtransactions or e-sports. Which means they only make money off of someone who buys their game, not from someone who is still playing it 2 weeks later. Sales quantity over product quality. That\\'s their business model. They add more and more new creatures and items every month to stay relevant and lure in new people, but the same bugs and annoyances that have been around for years are still unchanged.\\nARK is supposedly still in-development, and the idea is that we give them money to finish the game. But instead they have taken all that money to make a paid DLC. This reveals just how low gameplay and player loyalty really are on their priority list.',\n",

I've been through this game and all its rollercoaster crazy nerfs, updates and poor management. I cannot recommend this game or the DLC to anyone anymore in good concience. Do not buy this game!! Do not waste your money!!\\nThe developers keep making promises time and time again and pull through maybe 20% of the time, AT BEST. They rarely listen to the customers, the people giving the feedback they claim to want, about core issues with the game. Things like dinosaurs vanishing, drops in preformance, balance issues after they nerfed so much stuff playing the game isn't even worth it anymore.

       " \"Before you read into this review, let me ask you one question. Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe. \\nWarframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture. \\nWarframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free. \\nWarframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please.\\nThe Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol,  a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in. \\nAnd then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee.\\nWe've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine. \\nMelee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3. \\nSo yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative. \\nThat said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.\",\n",

       " \"The best F2P game I've ever come across. A fair bit buggy, but that's to be expected. The amount of content/updates that are constantly added to the game are insane. To give an example: If you were to compare what Warframe is now to what it was back in 2013, you'd be playing a completely different standalone game in a technical sense. There's so much to cover that I cannot fit it all into one review, but let's start with the fundamentals. The only other shooter I've played with mechanical depth that can hold a candle to what Warframe allows would be Resident Evil 6. This game's combat system is that deep. I'm not talking about things like Mods or attribute values, I'm talking about the sheer number of movement and attack options you have.\\nIn default mode, the shooting mechanics are pretty straight-forward. But the moment you hit the key to switch to a dedicated melee mode, the game reveals its mechanical complexity. With melee now your primary means of attack, you're able to empower attacks, block/parry, do combos through the use of Stance mods. The game now resembles something closer to a simplified version of Devil May Cry than an traditional shooter. Delaying your melee attacks at key points in animations will allow you to do a comboed move rather than a generic slash. And with most Stance mods having at least 5 combo chains, (in addition to some weapons having multiple dedicated Stance mods) the skill ceiling is significantly increased.\\nBeyond that are your movement options. You can do a sliding slash both on the ground and mid-air. You can run on and scale/hang from walls, dodge in any direction, and can even divekick enemies to knock them down or springboard off of friends and foes alike to complement your standard double jump.\\nThe basic aspects of combat are further supported via the use of Mods. Mods are items that fit into weapons and Warframes alike to help improve and tailor the player's chosen combat style. Every item has 10 Mod slots and 1 Stance or Aura slot. Each Mod has a number value that deducts from a point pool on a chosen item. Mods can also be fused with other mods to improve their effects. Weapons are also able to be fitted with different combinations of elemental mods to produce a new effect. It it through this system that allows Warframe to appeal to virtually any type of player's preferred approach to combat.\\nCustomization is a large part of Warframe, whether aesthetic or stat-wise. You're even able to choose your own ship (though such a choice is purely for show), customize the interior of it along with your frames, weapons etc. Better yet, most Warframes and even certain cosmetic items can be aquired simply through grinding.\\nThis, however, brings us to some of the cons that Warframe can rely on a bit too much at times. The game is very grind-heavy and can eventually wear an individual down as you run the same missions over and over to acquire a certain blue-print, To its benefit, there are a variety of mission types and enviornmental tile sets to go along with them. Furthermore, the game is exceptionally optimized; and is able to keep literally dozens of enemies on screen with respective particle and weapons effects without dropping below 45-50 on a mid-range computer (I had an GTX 660 as reference).\\nAnother problem the game has is its inclination towards being buggy. One of the worst I've heard of so far is the inital Archwing mission causing the game to outright lock up when the game is in Directx 11 mode. There are also numerous other bugs that will crop up as a player puts more and more time into the game.\\nCertain cosmetic items (and even Warframes) are sometimes only purchasable with Platinum, which requires that players spend real money or trade/sell in-game items to other players for Platinum (if one does not wish to spend real money).\\nStory-wise, the game explains very little to the player up front and uses Codexs to allow the player to piece the lore together ala. Dark Souls. With multiple factions each having their own agendas in addition to the Tenno themselves, there is a lot of world building content for players to go through.\\nOverall though, it's an amazing and unique F2P game that will likely not be outdone by its competitors anytime soon. If ever.\\n8.2 out of 10.\",\n",

So either find a private community prior to purchase or do not buy. Also do not just tell me to play singleplayer, your response will be deleted.\\nI have played this game since day one alpha release, and I can tell you right now, there had to be a management and design shift right around march of 2016. In its infancy, the game was incredibly fun. It was a fight for survival, where you would try to get shelter up as fast as possible, just so little bugs wouldn\\'t eat you alive. After that you would gather resources, hunt for food, defend yourself, make armor and weapons. You would then set out for a tame, usually something small like a pig or a parasaur, maybe even a raptor if you want to live dangerous. This tame would help you gather more resources, as it could carry even more resources. This was a rinse and repeat cycle of taming new creatures to serve different purposes, to then help expand your base and get better and better tames, with an end goal of fighting a boss. \\nYou could go solo, or make/join a tribe, allowing several players to work together, this made the game INCREDIBLY more fun (getting on a bunch of high level raptors with friends and devouring anything you came across was incredibly satisfying). Then you could work with or against other tribes, as you could trade resources or give old tames if they are newer. You could also go to war with another tribe, attacking their base, proving your worth. The other option is to take your tame and go stomp the dude who just made his first thatch hut, this is where the problems start. At first there was only minor griefing and was mainly done by Brazilians (I don\\'t know why, and I have nothing against brazilian people, its just the griefers on the servers I played on way back were all brazilian). They would run up to you naked with a spear, and try and stab you to death. Usually you were with a tame or had a weapon and could easily deal with them, and to be honest, isnt really game breaking as hes just a naked dude with a spear. As more and more people became aware of what these guys were doing, it became less of a problem as anyone who found a Br (brazilian) would call it out, and we would stay on guard for a bit and they would eventually get tired of getting slaughtered and leave. \\nFast foward a few months, and now they updated the pteranadon, a fast flyer for those who dont know, giving it a barrel attack move. This would increase the damage it did significantly, and make it move incredibly fast. This was cool at first, but was quickly adopted by more advanced griefers, as pteranadons were very easy tames. The game quickly became litered with people getting pteras, flying around and dashing through people, killing them, or worse, swooping in extremely fast, picking them up, flying high, and dropping them, causing no kill message to occur. This was an insane problem for newer players as they had no way of fighting back, causing them to get whiped repeatedly for just attempting to play the game, and was even an issue for advanced players as if you had things like rifles on your body and he insta killed you before you could kill him, the guns were now his and he could grief even more people with them. As far as I am aware, the ptera issue is still highly presistant to-date. \\nThe next issue was server dominance. Some servers would get to the point where only one tribe was on them as they whiped out every other tribe on the server. Many of the now \"legacy\" servers still have this issue, and its bound to happen with the new ones. If you go on one of these dominated servers, not knowing it, you would wake up and your character would be handcuffed,  in a prison with full weight so you couldn\\'t jump to drain stamana to die, so unless you wanted to wait 2 hours for your food to run out and starve everytime you wanted to start over on that server, you just ditched that server and looked elsewhere. I actually met the individual who made spawn camping a bannable offense, as he spent 2 real life days with a friend, building metal traps at each and every spawn location on the map, trapping any character who freshly spawned on the server, This was in an attempt to lock down their server to the point that they wouldn\\'t have to worry about sweeping their server every day to make sure no new spawns showed up. Now this was a really messed up thing, but at least it was contained to that server, keyword being was.\\nNow with the two issues I just told you about, and the devs doing NOTHING to stop it (except for the spawn camping, but i\\'ll get to why they banned that later), they did the last thing anyone but griefers and mega-tribes wanted. They added server transfering. Now in theroy this is to allow active players to swap from an inactive server to a active one, without losing all of their stuff. This is actually really neat, and if it was only used for this purpose then I\\'m all for it. What happened though was there was a very short cooldown on transfering, and you could bring EVERYTHING from one server to the next, all tames, all gear, any/all supplies. In the following days, those mega-tribes I mentioned before, that were farming resources, extremely powerful tames, and extremely high quality gear, would start to server hop at night, when no one was on, starting in one corner of the map and working their way to the other, wiping out any and all tribes on said server, leaving everyone there, who has played for months or even over a year, and get wiped by guys they never saw before. As far as the ptera griefers went, they just transfered server to server, killing people, taking their stuff, than then leaving the server, with no way of knowing where they went, so there is no way to even attempt getting back at them.  \\nOnce all this happened, I stopped playing for a while, as so did many, but months later I heard they did away with server transfer, so I started playing again. They then released scorched earth, and a few buddies of mine and I got it and played together, and it was incredibly fun. Then came the patch notes, and guess what, server transfering was back, after a lot of people payed money for the expansion. \\nPlayers attempted to make server transfer non existent on the player side, by blocking the obilesk, the giant pointy towers, as thats how you would transfer stuff. The devs later made it to where at any loot drop, you could transfer stuff, this led players to blocking loot drops, meaning now all that rare loot, you could no longer aquire. The devs then made drops land on top of objects, meaning you could no longer block them, and made blocking oblisk bannable. This lead to server transfer becoming an issue again, and people started getting unfairly wiped again by people who used unethical methods of warfare and would raid offline tribes.\\nIt then became clear their goals were to scam people into buying the game, and then ruin it after they get it so they can shut down servers. At this point, bugs were not being fixed, and more and more unbalanced content, that only made mega tribes stronger, was being released. This was clearly to reel in new players, with all the cool videos of the game, only to find out its griefer city. Now, remember when I said I\\'d explain why spawn camping was specifically the only griefing made banable? It was because if a new player jumped on a dominated server, unknowingly, and was spawn camped, they would maybe try 2-3 more times, but would probably give up, uninstall the game and get a refund. By banning spawn camping, new and unsuspecting players would easily be able to play past the 2 hour refund window before learning all their hard work was for nothing as their character ends up in a prison and everything they made, just gone.',\n",

       " \"I purchased ARK almost as soon as it came up on Early Access back in June of 2015. I've seen ARK evolve from its earliest days to where it stands now. I also own the dubious Scorched Earth expansion. I've taken part in pretty much every kind of activity to be found in ARK: solo building, working with small public tribes, all the way up to large scale alpha tribe vs alpha tribe PVP. Granted, there are -plenty- of people who have more time in ARK than me, but I've pretty much seen it all. Now with all that said, and considering everything I've seen and played, I cannot recommend ARK. Here's why.\\nIf you really, really wanted to boil it down into the most basic explaination possible, it's because ARKs combat is simply not fun. All the other issues in the game all relate back to this point in one way or the other. Allow me to explain. \\nLook at ARKs promotional videos and ask yourself what you see. You'll see armies of players alongside T-Rexes fighting across open fields. You'll see epic assaults on heavily defended bases by seige platforms mounted on mighty dinosaurs. Look at the promotional pictures here on Steam. You'll see trader caravans escorted by raptor cavalry making long treks across the island. You are probably thinking of buying the game so you too can take part in these epic struggles for survival.  \\nI'll tell you right now that you will NEVER experience ANY of that. Wanna know how ARK combat REALLY goes down? You farm up C4 for a week and then wait for your target to go offline. Then you and your tribe go to their base, which is in fact not an epic castle but a metal cube slathered in auto-turrets, and you drop friggin turtles on their base until their turrets run out of ammo. Then you take your C4 and blow your way in. If their dinosaurs are all on passive stance, just shoot them in the face until they die. If they are on nuetral, lure them out of the base and have your own dinos kill them at your leisure. Once all their dinos are dead, just keep blowing stuff up and stealing everything until you run out of explosives. If your REALLY lucky, one of their guys might get on and you MIGHT have a firefight. Then the next morning you can get on and hear them crying that they lost 6 months of work in one night. Eventually, one day you will suffer the same fate. Of course, all of this is assuming that you and your tribe reach the point where you can raid bases, and that you and your tribe weren't effortlessly curbstomped by an already established tribe the moment you set down your first foundation. \\nThe entire game, and I do mean the ENTIRE GAME, consists of nothing but months of grinding resources to do that exact thing. ARK demands that you invest so much time in it that it might as well be a part time job, and when the chips are down and all is said and done, the end result of all your labor is going to be blowing up a metal cube. Every other activity in the game is nothing but grinding up to get to that point. \\nIn summery, all the neat gear, all the cool dinosaurs, and all the other features of ARK become a zero sum game when the end experience is something as uninspiring as offline raiding.\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\nAddendum: It has come to my attention that many people are expressing their opinion that options such as PvE mode, private servers, mods, etc invalidate my points and redeem the game. \\nFirstly, if the community of players have to start enforcing their own personal rules (ie. private servers) or adding their own content (ie. mods) in order to make the game palpable, then that is a telling sign that the games core, fundemental mechanics are intrinsically flawed. I do not believe it is the responsibility of the community to fix a games flaws. Things like mods and private servers should be tools to enchance an already well built game, not used as crutches to sidestep a games core issues. I am writing my review concerning the game as the developers intended it to be played; which I believe has serious shortcomings that show no signs of getting fixed. I don't think its fair to potential customers to review a game any other way.\\nSecondly, PVE servers suffer from a myriad of problems. First and foremost, by eliminating direct player competition, you remove about 50% of the games entire premise. I found that some of the most fun aspects of ARK involved server politics such as alliances, betrayals, territorial skirmishes, rescues, ambushes, etc etc. By taking out any form of player vs player engagments, you can forget about all that. Which leaves you with... what exactly? You will collect dinosaurs to sit in your corral, you go spulunking through a few caves, and MAYBE if your REALLY lucky, you'll fight a boss with some other players, although good luck getting enough people to help you with that last one. The fact of the matter is that the PVE elements to this game, while much deeper than other survival games out there, are simply not compelling enough to stand on their own two feet. That's not even touching on the fact that PVE servers STILL have ways where other players can screw you over (for example, surrounding your base with foundations to prevent you from building, and preventing resources from spawning nearby) and since it's a PVE server you have absolutely no methods of retaliating.\\nARK has great potential and can frankly be a lot of fun. People wouldn't spend 500+ hours in this game if it wasn't at least kinda fun. However, the fact of the matter is that it's potential is horribly squandered by boring combat, tedious grinding, balance issues, and several downright stupid mechanics (bringing back server transfers? After what happened last time? Really?). Paying customers should not have to put up with this considering how long ARK has been in development. At this point, it's obvious the game is only going downhill, so I can't recommend it to new players.\",\n",

       " 'Well lets start with what kind of game Warframe actualy is. It\\'s published by DE (digitals extremes), it\\'s action game (someone would even say ninja game even though there are no ninjas in this game), no doubts about this and it\\'s sci-fi game, also no doubts about this thing, and it\\'s also 3rd person shooter right? Well I think we have 1st doubt right here, because you see, even though warframe is 3rd person without any possibility to go to 1st person it\\'s not just a shooter, in fact melee system i (imo) way better than gun system. But i will talk about weapons later.\\nNow let\\'s talk loadout and gear. You play as \\n a.k.a \"space ninja suit with awsung powers\" Right now there are 33 warframes (when we don\\'t count \"prime\" frames -> better versions of normal frames with same powers but just slightly better stats like armor, health etc.) Every one completely diferent than others with unique looks and abilities. About year ago there were 281 weapons in total, so now it\\'s easily over 300. You can choose from primary weapons, secondary weapons and melee weapons, there are also better variants of regular weapons (\"prime\", \"wraith\", \"vandal\" and very special \"dex\" right now there are only 3 dex weapons because they were added as anniversary) but i will talk about them later together with factions and some lore (if i won\\'t forget that is). And with weapons it\\'s the same... they are all unique from other weapons (well... at least with appearance because you cant make that much of a difference in stats) that said, there are still varieties of weapons. (i will put link for wiki if you will be actually interested)\\nFor \\n there are rifles, snipers, shotguns, bows, launchers, \"specials\" (stuff like flamethrowers and LMG weapons and they are taken as rifles ingame) and spearguns (you can shoot or you can throw) \\n are pretty similar (but ingame they are not as divided, they\\'re just secondary weapons) but you can find single held / dual held pistols (they dont look and usualy dont function like normal pistols, but it\\'s closest to real life pistols than anything else) shotgun secondaries (also one handed / two handed), shotgun-pellet secondarY (shotgun that can fire normal shotgun pellets or shoot slug with alternative fire), yet there is only one weapon like that, throwing secondaries (throwing stars and knifes), beam secondaries (they deal dmg/s in beam, they dont have bullets... duh)\\nAnd finaly \\n... so there are:\\nBlade and whips, daggers, dual daggers, swords, dual swords, claws, fist weapons, gunblades, heavy blades, hammers, hybrid weapons (two handed sword that can be changed into dual swords), machetes (most of them suck... :D at least that\\'s what most of people think, but with new stance they are finaly good :D), nikanas (basicly katanas), nunchakus, polearms, rapiers, scythes, sparring weapons, staves, sword and shields, glaives, tonfas and whips. Over 100 melee weapons in total. Also i mentioned \"stance\" earlier, stance is mod that you can put on melee (every melee type has its own stances) that allow you to make melee combos (that is what i meant when i said melee system is better than gun system).\\nAnd here is the weapons list if you want any details: \\nAlso you can have \\n (not talking about weapons anymore, but still talking about loadout) you can either have small robot-ish things -> \"sentinels\" that fly behind you (they have diferent mods that allow them to have specific role, by that i mean there is \"shade\" that can make you invisibru or there is \"helios\" that scans things for you - that is for codex, ingame stuff that realy doesn\\'t affect gameplay) and they use their own weapons, but you cant see them, or you can have live companions, cat a.k.a \"kavat\" or dog a.k.a \"kubrow\" there are several types of kavats and kubrows (including infested kubrow) that also have mods for specific attacks. Also you can modify their looks, you can add armor to both sentinels and animals, but it doesnt affect stats, it\\'s purely just for sake of fashion. Also you can\\'t have two comapions active at once.\\nI should not forget about \\n -> special mode where you get pairs of space wings and new space weapons (only primary and melee) and you fight in space. It\\'s fun feature in to the game, but it is annoying after a while, but dont worry you will have fun with it first couple of dozen hours of playing.\\nNow when damage dealing things are behind us let\\'s talk a bit about \\n it self. Loong time ago there was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dmg system and then DE made \"damage 2.0\" and now we have complex damage system. Basicly almost all weapons have physical damage: impact, puncture and slash ÿou can add critical chance and you can add status effects on them, every type of damage is strong and weak against some types of enemies, if you are realy interested look here: ',\n",

       " 'I know, I know. Another negative Warframe review from a salty player with lots of hours in the game. How original.\\nLook, you\\'ve probably heard plenty of crap about this game from other negative reviews, but this is just my two cents:\\nFor the amount of time you put into this game to earn things, you could achieve so much more in other games.\\nFor the amount of money you put into this game, you could gain so much more from other free-to-play titles.\\nBut what is it recently that made me quit?\\nWell, a fair few months ago, when Vauban Prime came out, I took a ~8 month break from the game, because of how unbelievably grindy it got. DE (the developers) increased the resource cost of things astronomically - like how some resources can only be obtained during rare, limited-time missions (nitain extract) or rare resources that remove themselves from your inventory after just 24 hours (Argon Crystals).\\nBut it\\'s okay, because DE releases fresh new content sometimes, right? Well, every time DE implements something, it\\'s terribly implemented. Atrociously so. But sometimes DE comes back and revisits this content, sticks \"2.0\" at the end of the name, and treat it like a whole new thing. They might fix some issues, but introduce a slew of new problems.\\nAn example of this is the \"focus\" system. Basically, without spoilers, you get certain types of XP for certain types of skill trees by using weapons or gear with a certain attatchment on them. When this was introduced, gaining \"focus\" points was ridiculously slow. After a while, DE responded to community complaints by advertising that they\\'d introduce a consumable that would appear on the map after certain time intervals, and give all players a 6x multiplier on their focus gains. Awesome, right?\\nWhat they really did was nerf how much Focus you get by making it an absolutely tiny fraction of what people were initially complaining about - then the 6x multiplier would only make up for the nerf. This is in the same update, mind you. And DE didn\\'t communicate this at all.\\nAnd now they\\'ve moved on again, forgetting about the focus system, just like every other previously implemented system in the game.\\nUpdate 18.13 introduced nerfs to warframes (exoskeletons that are essentially interchangable classes) that didn\\'t deserve a nerf. Many warframes that previously filled niche purposes were suddenly completely useless or outdone by other warframes. Certain builds people had on their warframes were now irrelevant. It was a♥♥♥♥♥♥show. And DE left it like that.\\nBut for the longest time, people had been asking DE to balance all weapons in the game. Because there are hundreds of them - and it\\'s a mess. Some can instantly wipe out all high level enemies in the vicinity, others require constant firing for minutes on end just to take down the same enemy. It is the worst I\\'ve ever seen in any game.\\nBut that\\'s okay, because DE created a fix that came with update 19, otherwise known as The War Within. This fix would be known as...\\nRiven mods. Basically, these are meant to be how DE rebalances the weapons of Warframe. And it is just the worst thing I\\'ve ever seen be added to the game.\\nBasically, Riven mods are mods for your gear that make them better. And they can make them way better. The problem? This didn\\'t just apply to the terrible weapons that needed rebalancing - this applied to all weapons. And this is meant to be the fix that rebalanced weapons. I cannot fathom the stupidity behind this decision. It\\'s laziness and stupidity.\\nWant to rebalance all weapons in the game, just like the players asked for? Sweet! Players will now have to grind against a time-locked grind on sortie (daily) missions for a small chance at obtaining a Riven mod, which then requires player to complete another arbitrary task just to \"unveil\" the Riven mod and make it usable, and then the player is left in the hands of RNG on what weapon the Riven mod worked with.\\nThat\\'s right, Riven mods are locked to only working with ONE weapon. Just one. Out of hundreds. It could be something you don\\'t even own. It could be for a useless weapon, and still not make it good enough to compete with the high-tier weapons, or just be further nerfs to what are already the best weapons in the game.\\nSo what do these Riven mods do? \\n These mods can do anything from giving a flat-out boost to damage, coming with useless buffs (adding additional % slash damage on a weapon that only 1% of it\\'s damage as slash) or even nerfs, such as decreased damage and increased recoil.\\nDidn\\'t like the way your Riven mod came out? You can reroll the traits it has with a whole new resource that requires a constant, conscious effort to grind, all while the cost for re-rolling your Rivens increases with every re-roll.\\nHowever, DE did make two fixes: they capped the resource increase for re-rolling Rivens to 3500 kuva, and made it so lesser-used weapons gain stronger buffs from Riven mods. But only after community outcry. Because the devs are so lazy, oblivious and moronic that it took the players say \"umm, buffing \\n with rare mods doesn\\'t fix the weapon balance issues\" for them to change anything. And when they did \"fix\" it, it barely made a difference.\\nThe Glast Gambit came out a few days before I wrote this review. With it, a new weapon was introduced - the Hema, and a new warframe - Nidus.\\nNow, what\\'s great about some warframes is that you can get their parts in quests. Sure, these quests were super grindy, but it was better than the alternative - many warframes in the game can only be obtained by having boss enemies drop CERTAIN PARTS of CERTAIN WARFRAMES which requires credits, resources and TWELVE HOURS EACH TO BUIILD and THEN you may construct the warframe with the final stage of crafting - actually constructing the warframe. Which takes SEVENTY-TWO HOURS.\\nIn quests, as you complete each grindy objective, you\\'re rewarded with a part, which you craft - for credits, resources, and and a twelve hour wait. But it\\'s better than having the part drop from a boss - where there is only an obscure chance that you get the part you want. This was the case with the warframe known as Chroma.\\nDE decided Chroma was clearly too easy to get, after a while, and decided to split up the pieces and making rewards for clearing different systems, sets of levels, and side objectives. Yep.\\nNow, the Glast Gambit rewards you with one piece of the Nidus warframe - the blueprint. Not other part. The other parts can only be obtained from a LOW DROP RATE from only EVERY FOURTH ROUND from a \\n That\\'s right. You have a low chance every foruth round after much repitition on just one level - the only level to contain this new game mode - and play it over and over and over and over again until you get the warframe parts. Which then require twelve hours, some credits and some resources to complete. And then you may build the warframe - requiring a 72 hour wait.\\nWell, that\\'s♥♥♥♥♥♥ So what about the new weapon, the Hema?\\nIt requires mutagen samples. A lot. Mutagen samples are a very uncommon resource that can only be found in certain areas of the game, and \\n Now, you see, weapon research gets a bit cheaper when your clan has less players. So those clans dedicated to helping out new players? ♥♥♥♥ them. DE just♥♥♥♥♥♥on them. And you can only be in one clan at a time. So people are being mass-kicked from clans, and it\\'s anarchy. And DE doesn\\'t care. They want people spending real money to buy gear from them, and will encourage players to stab each other in the back to make a buck. What scum.\\nI\\'m done.

Every weapon, Warframe, Archwing etc. can be good. People often seem to think that the prime/stalker weapons are the only thing to use, and that the \"how to mod: ____\" videos on YouTube is the only well working option to make a weapon good. But that is in most cases a big mistake from the players. Sure a starting mk.1 weapon is not as good as the prime one, and of cause there is nothing bad about getting modding inspiration from videos. The thing is, if you put enough effort into a Weapon/Warframe/Archwing/Companion, then that might just work just as good. Why try to make the Ignis good, if you don\\'t like the way it\\'s shooting, why not go for an old school Burston if that\\'s what you prefer?\\nA lot of people seem to only focus on those things: ranking up and getting good loadouts. It\\'s like people seem to forget what the game is trying to offer you. Try to do something different if you don\\'t like the game. Join a clan, do some Archwing races, finish the quests, challenge yourself like how long can you defend the objective and even better, how long can your squard which you currently are chatting with, having a good time, laughing together about how stupid and yet addorable Clem is, defend the objective!\\nDon\\'t be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and join a clan because they\\'ve got full research and no taxes.

Though you don\\'t necessarily have to play with other people if you don\\'t want to, but it\\'s a lot faster trying to get things accomplished.

There are enemy factions at war with each other. Your job is to fight them. You can do spy missions, defense missions (defend cryostasis pod), exterminate missions (kill all enemies), etc. At the end of these missions you get rewards like blueprints to make weapons and new warframes, component parts, credits (in-game currency), mods (which you can equip on your weapons and warframes.... mods like Melee damage +90%, etc). You can customize the colors of your weapons and warframes, customize the interior of your spaceship, you can have a sentinel or pet to assist you in battle, just all kinds of cool stuff here and there. Then there\\'s this other currency called Platinum, which you have to buy with real money, or another way to get Platinum is to farm for prime parts to sell to other players. You need this if you run out of space to use weapons and warframes, or if you want to buy accessories for your appearance, speed up the building process of weapons, warframes, etc.\\nPersonally what I think is a pain in the az, are the wait times you have to endure when building sh*t. OH WHAT\\'S THAT? You FINALLY got all the parts to build the warframe or weapon you\\'ve been wanting? It\\'ll only take 3 f*ckin\\' days to build it :D Don\\'t like waiting that long? Spend some plat to speed it up! Don\\'t have plat? Welp..... guess you\\'ll just be waiting then :D ....... or you can.... you know, buy some plat? :D Oh and don\\'t forget to take your Master Rank test to increase your rank to use better weapons, etc! Oh you failed? Welp...... 24 hour wai..WHAT THE F*CK!!!\\nThen of course before you can even build your stuff you need the parts first, which requires mindless grinding and a chunk of time. And there\\'s no guarantee you\\'ll actually get the specific parts you want because of the RNG system. Like for example, there\\'s Prime versions of Warframes and weapons you can get, and in order to get them you need to get relics (objects that you obtain from doing missions which hold specific prime parts within them). To get the prime parts from the relics you need to do Void Fissure missions, which is basically you fighting these holy looking azholes and getting them to drop this stuff called reactant which will crack open the relic once you have 10 reactant. Sounds easy, but the problem is that there are 6 prime parts in the relic, and the game randomly picks an item out of the relic. Or if you\\'re playing with 3 other people the game will randomly pick 1 prime part from each persons relic, thus making farming a bit easier. So that gives you an idea of how time consuming this process can be when you\\'re trying to farm for something specific. This game is nothing but poke and hope and saying \"Hey guys look at this stuff I have that you don\\'t have\", and definitely isn\\'t for the impatient lol. That\\'s all I\\'ve been doing for almost 700 f*ckin hours, not that I\\'m complaining but yeah this will suck the soul out of you and possibly turn you into a Warframe crackhead.\\nAs for the Warframe Community, this game surprisingly has some really nice people that are willing to help you out if you\\'re not afraid to ask. And in a way I guess it makes sense considering this game literally doesn\\'t teach you sh*t, doesn\\'t handwalk you at all, barely gives you any instructions as to what the f*ck is going on and how to play the game. I had to look up most information on the internet, the Warframe Wiki and a bunch of YouTube videos. I think the developers need to step it up in that department as well as other aspects. As mentioned above, I\\'m very asocial and hate people but this game kinda\\' showed me that not everybody on the planet is a d*khead with the mindset of a 12 year old. One random guy saw me asking for help in the region chat, decided to personally message me, and spent like 400,000 credits to upgrade some mods for me and spent a bit of Platinum to help me out. Completely shocked me I\\'ll be honest. ALTHOUGH, some of the players on here are big babies.... like actual manchildren no joke. \\nThere are warframe players in this game with Elitist mentalities that will throw fits when you don\\'t play the game the way they want you to play, the \"hardcore math on paper tryhards\" and it\\'s quite annoying... especially for someone like me. It\\'s very rare that you encounter these turds, but every now and then it happens. Like this one time I was playing as Valkyr Prime (a very melee heavy warframe) and was doing a Sortie mission called Mobile Defense, where you have to go to a spot and kill the enemies and keep them from destroying data you\\'re protecting. I was playing with 3 other randoms and this guy was btching because I was getting most of the kills, said he can\\'t stand Valkyr and told me I need to pick a better warframe lol. I\\'m sorry but last time I checked I thought it was Valkyr\\'s job to go around and tear sh*t apart? lol I mean honestly it\\'s not my problem if you\\'re slow at killing enemies, but I\\'m the one that needs to pick a better frame? Don\\'t whine and b*tch to me, go cry to the developers and tell them to nerf Valkyr if you don\\'t like it lol. On that note, I think I need to take a break from this game, because f*ck anxiety XD\\nI do enjoy the game though, I\\'d be lying if I said I didn\\'t, so thumbs up.',\n",
       " \"TL;DR at the bottom.\\nMain features at the bottom before TL;DR\\nCons:\\n1. Pretty bad tutorial.\\nThe tutorial simply guides you through basic combat, and nothing more. The more complicated mechanics such as mods and damage types are barely touched on. These two main mechanics are crucial in-game, and due to the lack of a tutorial for it, I've encountered far too many new players who are clueless. You will have to google for a crap ton of information. (Bless the wiki page)\\n2. Pay-4-Convenience.\\nIf you're rich, you get through majority of the game faster. But it is NOT Pay-2-Win. Everything is obtainable, and the grind isn't insane unless RNGesus hates you. A person who paid money and a free-to-play player will end up with the exact same gear. Essentially, you buy time in this game, and nothing more.\\n3. Limited areas to play in.\\nIt's not open-world. Instances have a certain tileset for each planet. It randomizes, but generally remains the same. There are, of course, new tilesets added in certain updates.\\n4. It's easy to get burnt out.\\nBy burnt out, I mean that you'll probably play the game on and off when you first start. This is due to the long waiting times for crafting new items, which are the only way you can get new items on your own. That tied with the daily trade limit makes it difficult to play for several hours straight. But once you've attained a fair amount of items, getting burnt out becomes few and far between.\\n5. You're free to do what you want.\\nThis can't be a bad thing, right?  But it is for those who want some form of direction in a game.  I initially found it really hard to stick to playing this game. I love every aspect of it, but having no actual goal is painful. This game is recommended for those who like loot-based games like Diablo 3.\\nPros:\\n1. Everything is obtainable if you play the game. (With the exception of the Founders Pack)\\nYeah, play the game and get everything. Simple as that. Wanna get something that is no longer available? Trade. \\n2. Fantastic Graphics on low-end PCs\\nI'm able to run this on a PC with only 2GB of RAM and an Intel Graphics card. I've upgraded since then, but it runs at a smooth 30 FPS on that disgusting old rig.\\n3. Gameplay.\\nGameplay doesn't get dull, unless you're one of those cancerous people who plays Ash-hole. Fast paced, and both melee-only and ranged-only builds are viable. \\n4. The Dev team.\\nIt's clear that the Warframe dev team cares about the game and does not try to turn it into a cash-grab. New expansion? Free. New item being released? Don't need to fork up any money. New mission? Do the pre-reqs and gain access to it. Entirely new mechanic that could possibly act as DLC? FREEEEE.\\n5. Community.\\nYou will rarely ever encounter any cancer players. Why? Because Warframe heavily relies on working with others. If you're a horrible person to group with, you'll build up a bad rep and eventually no one will group with you. The downsides of being an♥♥♥♥♥are so huge, that if Kanye played this game, you'd think he's Oprah or Ellen or one of those nice people that everyone likes.\\nFeatures\\n+ A lot of 'Warframes' which act as classes (extremely flexible)\\n+ Detailed mechanics (modding, damage 2.0)\\n+ Large amount of viable weapons (majority are extremely different from each, all are able to be molded to endgame)\\n+ Fantastic graphics (recently got a revamp with better smoke and fire physics)\\n+ Incredibly optimized (expect smooth framerates throughout)\\n+ Plenty of customization and cosmetics (you will rarely find another person that looks exactly like you)\\n- Dull movement system (despite having a parkour system, you'll be rolling/bullet jumping everywhere. This is starting to change with the added Orokin Moon Tileset)\\n- Limited areas to play in\\n- Repetitive (very limited number of mission types)\\n- PvP is pointless (you don't get much other than cosmetics)\\n- Ridiculously grindy\\n- A lot of flukes (there are certain builds that do all the work by pressing A SINGLE BUTTON. I kid you not. Check out 'Warframe draco runs' on youtube.)\\n- Limited trades each day (tallies with your Mastery Rank, which you can increase by leveling items)\\n- Limited inventory (appears as a cash grab quite early on, but you can earn Platinum through trading)\\n- Certain items are obtainable at certain times (2 main items; orokin catalyst and orokin reactor. They are untradable, and I've personally wasted over 400 Platinum on the market buying them because I missed an alert that was only available for 1 HOUR. The recipe that can be bought on the market is stupid)\\nTLDR;\\nIt's free, but can appear as P2W. \\nYou can obtain everything if you spend time and effort.\\nPlay if you like loot-based games.\\nExpect to wait. A lot.\\nCommunity is awesome.\\nDevs are awesome with constant updates and hotfixes.\\nBeing a Helicopter with dual axes is fun (yes you can do that in this game)\",\n",

But to make up for the lack of assisstance, most of the community would be willing to help you out if you just ask. Hell even sometimes give you free stuff to start off.\\nThe General Player: This is where the majority of both new and old players either get loads burnouts or just straight up quit the game. As all they see is \\'grind, grind, grind, and more grind\\'. Yes that is basically the entire game, but that means they\\'re missing the \\'hidden\\' message of the game (not really, just wanted to make it sound cool)\\nTo put it simply in my own words.. Because it\\'s fun. You\\'re probably thinking \"How the hell can endless hours of constant grinding be fun\" or something along those lines. Well that\\'s the exact same mindset for those new and old players who did quit the game, which leads to the final phase.\\nThe True Space Ninja: As repetitive any gamemode may be in Warframe, the amount of frames and weapons to choose from make the grind not just bearable, but legitimately fun. Even the worst kinds of weapons can be surprisngly effective or do the most hilarious things you would not see in any other game. The joy of bringing the wrong set up to a mission, then finding out by the end it worked better than expected.\\nTo avoid making this review anymore lenghty, I would say to truly enjoy Warframe; Change your usual set-up for certain mission types, challenge yourself with small but fun objectives while in mission, helping other players can be either  fustrating to funny experiences or a nice break from the constant grinding',\n",

       " 'Firstly lets talk about the basics, Warframe is a third-person over the shoulder Shooter, in it you control your character and complete missions and quests taking place on the different planets in the solar system, and if that sounds pretty generic thats because it probably is, however you are not some generic soldier, you take control of the Tenno, a race of basically humans designed as living weapons by a long dead ancient race, who are lead by The Lotus (space mum) to keep the peace in the solar system.\\nLets talk about the gameplay, The controls are pretty standard (WASD to move, Space to jump etc.), but theres actually a bit more to it than running around and shooting, some missions require you to be stealthy instead of aggressive, and since the Tenno are basically space ninjas you\\'d expect them to be able to pull of some acrobatics, and youd be right, its almost impossible to go anywhere without pulling off a little parkour in some of the missions. Now we come to the characters themselves, the Warframes, these are robotic suits-ish that the Tenno control and complete missions with, now theres actually a large amount of these ranging from healing ones, to defensive ones, stealthy ones, and aggressive one, each one coming with its own unique set of abilities, stats and look. There are no real \"Good\" Warframes as they are all good in there own way and who am i to tell you how to play your game. So just go out, find one that you like, and have fun.\\nSo the fact that Warframe is a free game might put you off, and yes even though warframe has a currency that is obtained by paying real money, but that does not mean this game is Pay To Win, this is because you are allowed to freely trade said currency with other players for their items, so if you dont want to use real money but you want an item that you can only get with the currency, then all you need to do is farm for a little bit, and sell of the items you got to players that want them, meaning that every single item can be obtained without having to pay any real money.\\nAll in all I highly reccomend you at least give Warframe a try, I mean, what harm can it do.\\ntl:dr\\nGood game, basic controls, basically 100% free to play, space mums included, check it out',\n",

       " \"Warframe is a fast-paced free to play third person co-op action game.\\nIn this game you operate so-called warframes, basically space ninjas with special abilities. You parkour all over the place, completing your objectives while killing bad guys in a multitude of ways. It's fun.\\nThe first thing you'll realize when you get the hang of Warframe is that there's a lot of content available. Mainly because the game has been getting frequent hotfixes and an impressive amount of major content updates since its release date. Secondly because the game doesn't shy away from complexity. Warframe is surprisingly in-depth. \\nIt's difficult to give an unambiguous description of the core gameplay. You generally go from planet to planet completing levels and quests while collecting resources to craft your arsenal and mods that make your character, weapons and companions stronger. A big part of the game is crafting equipment and leveling it up. The first time you level a piece of equipment up to the level cap, you'll gain Mastery Points. These level up your Mastery Rank. The Mastery Rank is an indicator of one's experience with the game. In essence, it's your account level. A higher MR means you'll be regarded as a more seasoned player. This incentivizes switching up your loadout as you progress through the game, leveling everything to the level cap at least once. This keeps things fresh. However, you don't have to switch up your equipment, if you don't want to. You could also stick with a certain setup and increase its effectiveness in certain areas through resetting its level, which indirectly increases the amount of mods you can install. What separates Warframe from others in the same genre is the choices it gives you when it comes to your playstyle and progression.\\nYou can blindly progress through the game if you want to, or you can invest time into knowing how the damage system works and mod your equipment to take advantage of it. The way damage and modding works heavily rewards the player for taking the time to understand the ins and outs of its mechanics. \\nOnce you have a certain build in mind, or you just want a specific weapon, warframe or companion, you'll have to start farming to get the stuff you need for it. This can be quite a grindfest, but fortunately this is something Warframe really nailed. The grind never feels unfair. It doesn't take a stupid amount of time to get what you want in this game. Sometimes you'll even end up with more things than you need, which you can sell or use later. Admittedly, from an outsider's perspective, this game just looks like a boring grind. However, the fast-paced action-focused gameplay, combined with the satisfaction of building your arsenal, more than makes up for it. This doesn't mean everyone will like it. If you hate grinding, you'll hate this game, regardless of the gameplay.\\nOf course, because Warframe is a free to play title, you also have the option to immediately acquire items in the game with real money. The game's premium currency, called Platinum, can be used to outright buy the items you want from the in-game store. Fortunately, the business model is another thing Warframe really nailed. If you have the time to grind, you're much better off doing that. As mentioned earlier: the grind never feels unfair. You never feel like you're being forced to spend real money on the game. If you don't have a lot of free time, you can just buy Platinum or Prime Access and get true value for your money. Furthermore, Platinum can be traded. This means the players can just trade items for the premium currency to buy stuff from the in-game store without spending a penny.\\nIn short: If you like action games and don't mind grinding, you should definitely try this one out.\",\n",

Especially if you have a friend with you.\\nThere is a great variety of Frames, Weapons and Mods to challenge yourself to learn.\\nCo-op is easy, and lag-free as far as what I've experienced.\\nThe cons are:\\nThe game can bug out at times.\\nMissions can be slightly repetitive, as said before. \\nSome players may just stand around doing nothing, or be bad at the game.\\nIn summary, pick this game up if you have a few friends with it, and become a ninja today.\",\n",

I have the most fun when I use all the tools available to me.

If you want cosmetics, you have the option of spending real money on Platinum (the game currency) or you can just trade other players the in-game items you earned for Platinum. I've played over 3,000 hours without spending any real money because I just sold in-game items to other players for Platinum and then used that Platinum to buy cosmetics.\\nWarframe has pretty good graphics, but doesn't actually require too much from your computer.

       " 'There is only one thing you need to know about Warframe: It\\'s free.\\nOh, maybe I didn\\'t make myself clear enough. When I say that Warframe is free, I mean, literally speaking, it is free. Still not clear enough? Alright, I\\'ll elaborate. Apart from two different types of items - appearance items (such as skins and coloring pallets) and weapon/Warframe slots - it is possible for all players to access almost all types of in game items and entities (apart from a few that are no longer available to everyone). In this manner, it is possible for you to obtain every Warframes (characters or so to speak), every weapons, every non-visual-based items and the likes. Of course, there are conditions to fulfill, and obtaining everything will most likely take up a good portion of your time (isn\\'t this what you are looking for?), but the point is, it is perfectly possible to play Warframe in the long run without paying a single cent. It\\'s your choice. \\nSo, what is Warframe? In this game, you are basically a character known as \"Tenno\" who fights battles within a futuristic solar system. You will be teaming up with 3 other Tennos (this is a 4 player co-op game) to complete missions laid out by Lotus, a female commander issuing you orders. Nah, she is nicer than your ex-girlfriend, so don\\'t worry about that. \\nYou will basically be facing three separate forces, Grineer, Corpus and the Infestation (think of the three races in Starcraft if you want to get a better idea). There are different types of missions, ranging from elimination, rescue, spy, to defense and rescue. As for weapons, basically you get to equip a primary weapon (rifle, shotgun, sniper and many others that are hard to categorize), a secondary weapon (categorization is hard for this as well) and a melee weapon (sword, mace, fist... you know the deal). As for your character, you will be using one out of the somewhat 10-ish (slightly less than 20, though the number is gradually increasing as more update comes by) Warframes. Each Warframe comes with different stats, such as self-repairing shields, like those in halo, health, energy (mana) and speed. Still, more importantly, each Warframe has its own unique set of 4 skills. These skills are great assets for the players as most of the times they will come in handy. One thing to note is that gender is preset, so those transsexuals don\\'t have to fake their gender anymore, which is, well ... you decide if it\\'s good or not. There are also mods (modifications) that you can insert into your weapons and Warframes to make them much stronger than they originally are. \\nOh and there are parkour. Learn how to press \"WASD\" + \"LShift\" + \"LCtrl\" + \"Space\" in fluid coordination. It will be helpful and painful, but you will definitely need them.\\nSimple?\\nUnlike many co-op shooters, Warframe definitely has its merits. One of the most apparent distinction of the game is that it has a leveling system that can be found in most MMOs. You can level up both your weapons and Warframes to a maximum rank of 30. Moreover, you can rank up your mods as well to make them more powerful. In this way, Warframe won\\'t be a simple \"run-shoot-kill see-score go-sleep\" type of game. Never. There are things more important than that.\\nAnother merit of Warframe is that there are frequent updates. When I say frequent, I mean FREQUENT, as in one big update per month or so. There will be new game modes, Warframes, weapons, mods ... etc. I mean, come on, who thinks that L4D2 came too fast after L4D1 is released? I do. Who is still waiting for L4D3 after all these years? I am. Who thinks that Gabe Newell should fulfill the unsaid promise of completing the trilogies of Valve games? I do. Come on, we have been waiting for L4D3 and Portal 3 and HL3, and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of waiting. This won\\'t happen for Warframe though. The game has a gradual and comfortable pace of updating. You get new contents every now and then, and they usually blends well with the game. Usually.\\nStill, like most games, there are pros and cons of Warframe and I have to sincerely admit that there are shortcomings with this game when compared to other games. One major shortcoming (I won\\'t say flaw) of this game is that it lacks a concrete story line. Apart from some trivial storytelling, there really aren\\'t much of a tale going on. There are stories told, I\\'m not saying there aren\\'t, but they are rather weak. I know, that is not their aim, and that is not really the point of Warframe, but compared to the rich (though monotonous) storyline of L4D and Portal, Warframe needs to good a better job here.\\nAlso, the game can be rather repetitive. You know, this applies for most Coop shooters, so there really isn\\'t much to say about this. Yeah, repetitive. \\nSo, in general, try Warframe. It\\'s free. If you don\\'t like it, drop it. Simple as that. If you do like it and if you feel that you will be playing it in the long run (like how I felt after my first 100th hours), do consider buying a little platinum to expand your weapon and Warframe slots. I bought like 19.90 USD worth of platinums. Not much, but it is the spirit that counts, right?',\n",
       " 'Warframe has come a long way from when i first started playing, but i can honestly say the majority of it was great! Let me start by describing what warframe is. Its an over the shoulder third-person shooter where you play the role of a ninja warrior in space. The solar system is in chaos, and it\\'s up to you to maintain the balance. With many weapon types to choose from, and different frames to use to suit your playstyle, the possibilities are endless. However there are certain strategies in higher level missions that even veteran players will tell you work. It\\'s pretty much an MMO at this point, so certain \"classes\" of warframes work better at farming resources on certain missions. The developers also release new content as operations to introduce the new features, for example, the newest addition was corpus dropships that drop squads of enemies into battle. It was introduced as Operation: Ambulas Reborn, which featured a reworked boss that dropped in from the ship with a squad of regular enemies. There were a few bugs at first, but the incredibly awesome support team was very quick to respond to reports and get back within 24-48 hours. All in all, this has become one of the best free to play games i have ever played, and the graphics do an excellent job of immersing you in a living, breathing world that is constantly changing. I have to say that there are certain aspects of the game which require you to pay for features. Such as certain weapons, cosmetic packs, etc. Other than that, if you work hard and spend a decent amount of time on it, everything important is attainable without paying money for it. I do encourage you to support the developers by buying things that you may like, but only at your own discretion. Speaking of which, there is also a thriving market for the ingame currency, platinum, where you can spend platinum to buy parts, weapon mods, and other hard to obtain aspects from other players, as well as selling your own parts and mods to other players to obtain platinum. The prices will indeed vary on the rarity of what you are trying to get, but there is also sites and a wiki for any questions you may have about said things. All in all i have had a great experience with this game, rather than reading my long-winded review about the game, why not try it yourself? It\\'s free! Also feel free to add me ingame and i will do my best to be as helpful as possible, my name is Mix_Masterson. See you on the battlefield, and have fun!',\n",

This means that if you play poorly and rely heavily on the end mission reward instead of doing stuff in the actual missions, you will need to grind more, so the less effort the more punished you will be, this is a common issue that leads to complaining and it's usually the player's fault.\\nThe players get more wacky and random as you progress as each player has his/her own definition of efficiency, initially you might be paired with players that have the same warframe and weapons as you, but later on a team is just as creative and cool to play with as the next 1000 missions that follow, so the game tries to keep things fresh, enviroments different and the gameplay fun.\\nIt really all comes down to what you want to do in the game, but do not expect no grind if you want to collect 20 frames and all the weapons, many users complain when in reality it's their fault.\\nThe game is really hard to balance, digital extremes does make an effort to try and keep the grind reasonable, for someone playing once a week this is an issue, but for someone playing daily, it doesn't take much time to get the new desired content and so the developers either introduce new grinding mechanics (that puts everyone on the same playing field for some time) or they introduce new resources, if they simply release something and use old resources or old mechanics, there will always be someone who can do that weapon instantly, no grinding required because it has been done in the past.\\nHowever, they have introduced many systems already and the game is becoming a bit overwelming on that aspect, to many currencies (ducats, credits, platinum,void traces,...), things to lvl up (focus, sindicates, warframe, weapons, mods) can also be a problem.\\nAt some point they will need to stop and need to polish what they currently have without making the playerbase wait months.\\nSo the game becomes super simple and easy for heavy and hardcore players, but super grindy for someone playing 1 mission a week, if that's the case then it is recomended that you lower your expectations on the time required to get a single warframe and that you create a more reasonable objective, do not aim to collect everything and then complain about lack of time to do it.\\nMusic is superb, graphics are great and the game compatible with legacy hardware and OS (like direct x9 graphic cards, windows xp,....) and the gameplay is super enjoyable.\\nThe downsides?\\n - for starters, prime access cost is the price of a tripple A game and this happens every 3 months for some discounted platinum, warframe, weapon and cosmetics.\\nThe game offers exceptional value for it's cost (free) but then has these unique cosmetics that are in a bundle that costs 60$, a single cosmetic and a few boosters for that price is a terrible value.\\n - tennogen item costs are absurd, 6€ for a single skin? no platinum cost, if it was a platinum cost then those trading would be rewarded for it, but by having it tied to steam things get problematic.\\n - Many bugs, especially client and host related bugs, it happens in pretty much every update, where colors, mechanics and features work greatly as the host, but quickly fall appart when you are the client, yes the game is p2p.\\nThings that worked well before end up breaking in the most insane ways possible, this happens in every game with updates, but in warframe it's just silly the ammount of things that stop working after a single big update.\\nSome updates are clearly rushed and the end result is atrocious sometimes.\\n - Regrind aspect, sometimes you will be regrinding for the same content, DE certainly doesn't like you to upgrade existing content, they prefer making you play again to lvl up something new that makes the old obsolete, for example you get the dera weapon but there is a different weapon called dera vandal, making the regular dera rather obsolete if your goal isn't mastery.\\nOverall a great game, a great free to play game, very friendly aproach on the f2p genre, DE is a bit on the greedy side of things but considering i can do anything in the game and the most i have payed in the game ends up being a 6€ skin, i believe the value beats any other game that i have played.\\nThe income for digital extremes comes mainly from the players that purchase plat and they often make bundles (like prime access) so that players feel inclided into buying the cosmetics, but if you only care about player quality, your own gameplay, then the game can offer that and charges nothing.\\nYou can essentially be the best warframe player outthere, do any mission you like, play the way you like and in the end not pay for anything.\",\n",

       " \"When I first tried out Warframe I didn't know what to expect. At first glance it didn't seem like much, but after getting into it I realized there's much more to it than I initially thought. I'll list the pros and cons about the game, based on my experience. Don't take this review for granted, its only my opinion after all.\\n- Plenty of frames to choose and play with: \\nwarframes or frames for short are what you play as in the game. Each frame has its own playstyle and set of unique abilities that you can choose from that you can then further customize based on your needs.\\n- A variety of game modes to mix up the gameplay:\\nThese are sufficient in quantity and have different objectives. In Defense you protect an artifact from the enemies, in Survival you simply survive for as long as you can, in Spy you must retrieve data from vaults, and so on.\\n- Huge selection of weapons to use:\\nThere's everything from simple weapons like knives and bows, to assault rifles and grenade launchers, as well as high tech energy weapons. There's enough to choose from to satisfy almost any playstyle.\\n- Mods:\\nAs you play you find various mods that you can use to improve and model your frames and weapons the way you want. Everything from basic health and damage increasing mods to complex mods that give you certain effects when hitting or killing an enemy in a specific way. There's also mods that give your frames useful passive abilities, as well as mods made specifically for a certain frame.\\n- Primes: Prime weapons, frames or mods are better versions of their original counterparts. The regular versions function well enough that the power gap isn't too big, so you don't need a prime to be good at the game.\\n- Freedom of customization:\\nWant a bow that shoots exploding arrows and causes electricity damage? Ever thought of trying out an assault rifle that shoots freezing bullets? Wondered how a pistol that causes radiation and corrosion is like? The game told me I can do all of that and much more!\\n- Freedom of playing the way you want:\\nA friend asked what sets of weapons frames have. He asked if a stealth frame has a bow and a dagger. I responded by taking a squishy little stealth frame into a Defense mission, chopped up the first squad of enemies with a giant two handed sword, killed the 2nd squad with a radiation spewing handgun then blew the remaining squads up with a grenade launcher. And the game was okay with that, you can put any weapon on any frame you want.\\n- The game is F2P (Free to play):\\nThis of course means that you try it out, play it for a bit and then decide if you like it or not. Almost all of the game's content is free. The devs are also pretty generous, often giving players events where they can acquire upgrading components for weapons/frames, special weapons and sometimes even cosmetics, completely for free.\\n- Trading:\\nYou can trade some (but not all) of the items you find in Warframe with other players. The game has its own trading chat to help you find what you're looking for, and there are filters to make searching even easier. You can even make platinum (the game's premium currency) by selling items you can get simply by playing the game.\\n- The community:\\nWarframe has one of the friendliest communities I ever saw in a video game. Players help each other out, veteran and new alike. New players have no problem getting advice when they need it, and even help in missions they can't complete on their own. Sure you might meet a toxic player every now and then, but every game has a few of those bad apples.\\n- Clans:\\nSmall to large groups of players that you can also become a part of. There are a huge amount of clans in Warframe, and you can make your own too if you want. Joining a clan gives you access to more weapons and some other useful items, as well as your own dojo where you can hang out in, or trade.\\n- Cosmetics:\\nThe game offers you a beautiful selection of colors to paint your warframe and your weapons with, as well as various attachments you can use from syandanas, shoulder and legs pads, chest plates and sugatras. Skins are also available. Most of these cost platinum, but that can easily be acquired through trading without having to spend a single penny. For those who wish to support the game and buy platinum, its easily affordable with coupons you can get from daily rewards. The cosmetics themselves aren't that expensive either.\\n- PvP:\\nWhile Warframe is mainly a PVE game, a PvP mode called Conclave is also available where you can fight against other players.\\n- Very grind heavy: Yes you can get almost all of the game's items for free by playing. No you won't get them all easily and/or quickly unless you're the god of luck. Grinding for resources, weapon/frame parts and mods can take up a lot of your time depending what you want. And that's just the start, because...\\n- RNG:\\nTied directly together with grinding. Only a few items in the game are a guaranteed drop, and for everything else you're at the mercy of a random number generator. You can get your item on the first try, or you can be there for a hundred missions and still have nothing. This applies to resources and mods, as well as parts for weapons and warframes. You'll always get something, but chances are it won't be what you want and/or need.\\nSometimes you'll even need to make a key/cypher/some other item to access the mission (for example the recent Razorback event) which costs resources, making it that more frustrating if you can't get the items you want.\\n- Levels and tilesets:\\nDon't get me wrong, they're pretty to look at and keep you amused for a good while, but eventually you'll notice you know all of them by memory. That exact same bridge, that same room, that familiar set of stairs you saw in several other different missions. You'll also likely be grinding for your items I mentioned in the exact same level too, over and over again.\\n- Demands dedication:\\nSimply put, if you want the best Warframe has to offer you'll have to play it a lot. New content's constantly coming out, and while that's a good thing if you can't really take longer break if you want to keep up. Combined with the grinding and RNG you have to play pretty regularly.\\n- Time limited special events:\\nWhat's that? You couldn't play the game during the unique event that lasted a few days because of real life stuff, or you couldn't play enough to get all the content it had to offer? Well too bad, kiss those rewards and the event away, because they're not gonna come back anytime soon.\\n- The Prime vault:\\nNew primes come out every once in a while, and when that happens they replace an older set of prime items that are moved into the vault. This basically means you can't farm for them anymore, unless you have relics to access the missions where their parts once dropped, or getting the parts from players who got them before they got vaulted by trading.\\n- Early game is confusing:\\nWhile the game has a tutorial and players are willing to help out new people, the game's amount of content and all the mechanics it has take a while to learn, confusing new players or turning them away from the game. When I started playing I was running around like a headless chicken trying to figure out what to do.\\n- Late game doesn't have much to do:\\nSo you decided to play a lot, testing yourself just how far the game will take you. You got all the available frames, you have an entire arsenal full of all sorts of weapons. You have acquired the best gear the game has to offer. You are now a master of Warframe, you can solo the hardest missions without breaking a sweat, the toughest enemies fall before you like insects, you're always the best player in your squad, you have a mountain of resources stockpiled from how many missions you've completed.\\nAnd then? Then you find you have nothing left to do because you already have everything you need, and you slowly get bored.\",\n",

       " 'Warframe is an impressive work of a game. You might think, just by looking at its store page with the \"Free to Play\" tag and the \"dlc(?)\" packs underneath that it\\'s Pay to Win.\\nThat is not the case. Not even a little bit. You can obtain everything non-cosmetic in the game without paying a dime. You can even trade rare items for the in-game currency, platinum. So you really can get everything without paying.\\nYou start off with little, taking a weapon of choice for a Primary, Secondary and a Melee weapon, as well as one of three Warframes. Your Warframe has certain abilities that set it aside from others. As you master your weapons and Warframe, The Lotus takes notice and allows you to test your abilities and Rank Up. After you\\'ve ranked up, you now have access to better weaponry to take on bigger things.\\nThe mission variety is good, the amount of weapons can be overwhelming, but there\\'s always something to do. Give this game a shot. DE is an excellent company, they do livestreams every other Friday(could be mistaken on schedule) and talk about what\\'s going on, what they\\'re working on and what they want to do.\\nThey listen to feedback from everywhere; Steam Forums(ugh), their own forums, or even Reddit. They are not a greedy company. Give the game a try, it\\'s pretty fun.',\n",
       " \"My initial impression of Warframe was that someone had made a huge mistake, and I'd received a rather expensive game for free. As it turns out, Warframe IS free. Which is incredible considering the polished graphics, and quality as it's presented.\\nDon't be fooled; Warframe is definitely a time sink. Levelling up a Warframe to use better weapons, to then level them further and unlock better mods for weapons - this cycle continues. There is a serious lack of content aside from the same set of missions. 'Smash 'em up carnage and mindless fun' is a great way to describe the game.\\n- A huge pull, Warframes, weapons, and ships are \\n customisable, and the sheer number of each available is insane. While there are real cash transactions, almost everything in the game can be crafted with some effort on your part, barring cosmetic skins/items. I do feel a little miffed that most colour palletes are also locked behind this paywall. I'm not PSYCHED to be a Red Power Ranger, but guess I will be one unless this changes.\\n- Saying this, the atmosphere and graphics are excellent. It plays and looks fantastic on my GTX1070, with the camera at a third person view, and OTS zooms for scoped or long-range weapons.\\n- Combat feels seamless in singleplayer, I have had no problems except for my own inadequacy with a gun (which is slowly improving.) With multiplayer, I have noticed a significant amount of movement lag.\\n- If you're used to being a long-term clicker, like me, your fingers are probably going to ache after CTRL+ SPACE/SHIFT jumping combos (but you do look hella cool.)\\nThere is a LOT of focus on co-op play, and if you suffer from anxiety as I do, I would suggest playing with friends only or changing settings for solo missions. Unfortunately, my experience of the public community is that it is quite a toxic one. Others may not feel this is the case, but for the majority of the time I've played and spent in public groups, there is a ton of verbal abuse over voice chat/nasty trolls, and as a new player it is -hugely- off-putting.  I have learned of the mute option since, but it feels that the longer a game is released, especially of the MMO variety, and the larger player base it gains, the worse the community gets. [Cue group rushed playthroughs, abuse, stress, panic attacks and not wanting to play again for extended periods of time on my part.]\\nI await the day a majority friendly community lasts in any MMO, but I may as well live in hope of Half-Life 3.\\n*As to the new Plains of Eidolon update; oh man, THE GRIND IS REAL. It feels as though the developers tried to create a rolling, open world landscape for players to explore and complete missions at their leisure, but the missions are really just repetitive bounties that you have to run all the way back and extract to the main hub to complete. That doesn't fit well with an open world setting.\\nRepeatable quests and bounties which are required for reputation gain \\n Feeling forced to grind them for rewards and necessary mats after a relatively 'do whatever you feel kind of vibe,' is odd. It would work well as an increment to a large update, but as the update itself, it feels rather shallow.*\",\n",

       " 'This game has a huge amount of potential, and it literally hurts to see it being done in such a bad way, this review will change the moment the major problems like game breaking bugs, optimization, easy dedicated server setup and at least a vague resemblence of balancing enters the game, until then I sadly have to give it a thumbs down.\\nSo, it\\'s been a while since my last review of ARK was out, and this one won\\'t get into as much detail as the last one sadly. Not because I\\'m missing the time, or there are fewer things to talk about, but simply the problem that Steam offers a cap on the length of it, and a proper done one would simply break this limit.\\nAnd before you ask why the heck one can even get so far: Yes, explaining the faults of this game alone takes that long! So I\\'ll try to make it short and into a list:\\nPros:\\n- Nice graphics\\n- Huge amounts of content\\n- Long possible playtime to do everything\\n- Dinosaurs! :p\\n- Riding those dinosaurs!\\n- Rather ok base building (this will be in the con part with a short description why as well)\\n- LOTS and lots of potential for the future.\\n- Active modding community\\n- Steadily added content (Also in the con, wait for it! ;) )\\nCons: (Oh boy, here they come sadly)\\n- The balancing is simply not there, not even closely, it\\'s so bad that you can count it as broken.\\n- Private servers are a chore, not even worth looking at unless you want to have hours of headaches to even set one up, not to speak about keeping it running.\\n- Tribe mechanics are simply broken, while single players need at least a week to level up to get to the interesting parts of the game, a 10-20 people tribe can push you trough the whole month long process of maxing your character in as much as an hour... yes, that broken.\\n- The steadily added content, breaking the balancing even further and implemented often in a way so previous content gets basically... obsolete from a game mechanics standpoint, which is always bad, the game isn\\'t getting richer, just bigger.\\n- Optimisation, don\\'t even get me started on this, one of the points I have to get a bit more in depth:\\nThe rendering isn\\'t finished properly, while wriggling and dancing trees in the distance and lightning mistakes are ok for an early access, it\\'s not only the minor bugs which ruin the gameplay. Many people aren\\'t able to start the game even with proper hardware, the autosaving of the game often causes freezes in the game, not from time to time but even to a point where every 5 seconds a 0,5 second freeze is incoming, imagine playing a single player map like this! Constant framedrops and the ability to look trough the map is a huge problem as well, as is getting stuck in random places and literally having to die to get free again is another. The server migration system is broken and often corrupts your character, making all your progress useless in a second and even dinosaurs you cared for for days or weeks can simply vanish trough the ground, just to loose your favourite one without your doing. And that\\'s just a SMALL portion of the problem.\\n- The building system, it\\'s nice in itself, but tedious. The ground isn\\'t even, so fiddling around to get the part where it belongs to is sometimes a hassle, and even if you manage to do it, the automatic snapping system to make it easier... is only making it harder. Instead of offering a simple button to force the parts to align in different directions it\\'s made by standing in a proper angle towards it, parts often sinking into the ground with no way is seeing where you build, or floating in the air without an option to make it look good. It needs serious overhauling, but that never has even been adressed as of yet.\\nBut, since I don\\'t want to make it too long I\\'ll move on to 2 seperate problems which isn\\'t the game itself, but rather the developers, something which in itself are major things ruining the trust of us consumers, things which should even be forbidden by laws which need to catch up. Well, but what could I mean to warrant such words even?\\n- The DLC is the first. The game is Early Access, and offers a PAID DLC! That in itself is unheard of, and even with the part that the studio has a working force especially dedicated to this, it doesn\\'t tend to go well as a customer. Imagine getting a microwave which burns your food or simply doesn\\'t heat it, a gamble if you would even get something good out of it. Not a company comes and offers you some gimmick for this microwave without even taking care of the faults it already has, adding even more problems to it, would you buy it? No? Didn\\'t think so as well, but that\\'s exactly what they are doing.\\n- And this brings me to the second absolutely disgusting thing to do: Price changes. The game had a former pricetag of 20€, which is a price fitting to the game, after all, it\\'s early access, has a lot of bugs, broken systems, no sort of resemblance of balance but in itself is fun. Well, now we got a lovely 60€ Pricetag, one which is used for RELEASED AAA titles normally, not for a broken heap of chunk trying to imitate a proper done AAA title, and that\\'s just... well... disgusting to see.\\nSo, you can make up your mind on your own if the massive downsides are worth to pay for a sandbox game with broken systems, balancing and even the chance you\\'re not able to play it. Official servers are literally cancer with elite-tribes running around bullying everyone else to keep the servers for themself. The self-made servers taking some sort of degree in IT to even set up properly and singleplayer not even offering you the chance to do everything as the engram system forces you to decide ahead of time... which is impossible with your first character.\\nTo end it I\\'ll say a few words about the developers: Don\\'t trust them even a single bit, they are talking about optimizing the game since over a year, with only minor changes coming out while the mass of updates are new (often broken) content which can\\'t be enjoyed after mentioning the myriad of problems surrounding the game. Their focus is off of what can be called proper game development, they milk the community for money in places where they shouldn\\'t and their most common things said to alleviate that is the mass of content we get for free. Wake up thought! Don\\'t blindly run into it thinking \"Wow, they are offering free content, not everyone does that!\" And yeah, you\\'re right! BUT! If a company brings you broken stuff, you think that some sort of compensation is needed after it for all the hassly they put you trough, it\\'s the same here. They simply give you free stuff so you keep being a customer and add a good review despite their messed up game and development focus.\\nIf you\\'ve already bought the game... well, hard to change that, but if you\\'re someone who is vague about buying it... please please don\\'t do it! Doing so only strenghtens their views that they can get away with this sort of thing, making it harder in the future for us consumers to get a proper product as other companies will follow their footsteps, releasing broken junk which will frustrate you sooner or later instead of being a good game.\\nThere are several other sandbox games out there, some running since years, older, with clunky UI\\'s, worse graphics and other focus, rather take one of those instead of this pile of unfinished junk, you\\'ll have a better time with RUST, Wurm Unlimited or some others out there.',\n",

Is there a single player? Yes. Is the game about taming and surviving in a dinosaur filled world? You Stegasaurus belive it.\\nIn retrospect, i would like to point out the devs dropped 3 minor patches in the course of 4-5 hours, to address hard and dubious complaints, and also went out of their way to include something that may or may not have been acceidently left out at publish, thats a good developer in my book. So say what you will about the serves being full on a great game, or say what you will about lazy devs who dropped 3 minor patches on a dime to keep the game from exploding.

       " 'Warframe is a free to play TPS / hack \\'n slash co-op game with stealth and parkour elements. In it the player becomes one of the Tenno, space ninjas awakened from a long slumber, who control powerful suits known as Warframes which provide different abilities and allow them to tackle on dangerous jobs from Lotus.\\nThe graphics are just incredible. Each location has its own design style, the environments are shiny and rich in details, while the special effects are just plain beautiful. The only downside might be the fact that the last one can be a little bit too distracting at times and hard to see through during a fight.\\nIn the sound department, the music is appriopriate to the situation (speeds up when in a fight, for example) and whatever plays in the background is usually the theme of the faction you\\'re fighting against (though it can get overriden by the boss\\' theme if someone like that appears). A few of the tracks deserve a mention for being just plain incredible, such as Drums of War, Becoming the Hunted, Cold and Gold, We Are Not Alone, Reap What You Sow and \\n. The sound effects aren\\'t anything special, but they are diverse enough to not get boring or tiring. The voice acting is also really good, even if a bit scarce.\\nThe gameplay consists of you and up to three other players deploying on a mission and completing a specific objective (like killing all enemies or capturing important targets) while moving through randomly-generated rooms. You get to use between three weapons - primary, secondary and melee (which can be of many different types, like bows, shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, pistols, shurikens, kunais, swords, axes, hammers, polearms, scythes, glaives, knuckles, gunblades.. yeah, this game has \\n of weapons) - as well as an assortment of movement options, including, but not limited to sprinting, sliding, wall-running etc. You can also attack enemies while performing any of those maneuvers, giving you a large degree of freedom as to how and when to move in and strike.\\nAs far as stealth elements go, you can obviously use cover to keep yourself out of sight of enemies. You can also use silent weapons like bows and shurikens to take them out from a distance, or sneak up behind them and perform an insta-kill stealth execution. Some abilities can also make you invisible or silence everything within a certain radius. The mechanics are very solid and it\\'s fun slicing stuff down.\\nThere is also the Archwing and its own missions, where you move in no-gravity using the eponymous mechanical wings, shooting down foes akin to a space shooter. While it isn\\'t as diverse as the standard gamemode, it is a good change of pace from time to time. Not to mention, even more awesome.\\nThe amount of equipment, types of environments, and missions you can encounter is staggering. The diversity is what keeps it from getting too stale.\\nAnother good thing is that the multiplayer functions pretty well - even with high ping, you will notice an obvious delay, but it won\\'t impact your experience or general gameplay as much as in some other games.\\nStory-wise, the game isn\\'t really all that rich, but it is solid nonetheless. There is a lot of lore in transcripts and descriptions of some weapons and Warframes, and the quests also provide an interesting narrative as far as the identity of Lotus and the Tenno themselves goes, as well as what happened in the past and what the player characters did before they were put to cryosleep. I\\'m not going to be spoiling anything, as you should discover it yourself, particularly when it comes to the newest Second Dream quest.\\nI think this is it for the pros, so let\\'s start counting out the cons. The game is still, quite obviously, a glorified grind to get better stuff. Fortunately, most of the time it\\'s somewhat fun to play.\\nSpeaking about multiplayer, if the host\\'s computer lags horribly due to all the stuff going on in the game, you can expect your gameplay to be similarly laggy, with everything \"flash stepping\" all over the place.\\nAnother bad thing is the fact that enemies are pretty stupid sometimes. They tend to take cover at not exactly the best spots, or forget that you just sped right past them and still sit there waiting in cover, just being covered from the wrong direction. Harder missions only strengthen the enemies\\' stats together with spawning elites more often, and sometimes new types of enemies.\\nAlso another thing is that the game requires a LOT of grinding to even get moderately powerful. At the beginning you\\'re going to struggle to complete the missions that aren\\'t the absolute simplest of all, since you don\\'t have much resources to manufacture new stuff, and the starting equipment is very weak. And even if you do get strong weapons, they\\'re not going to be powerful enough without a good assortment of high-rank mods for them to customize their damage output. Of course, if you have a friend who\\'s been playing the game for quite some time and is willing to help you out in getting started, this becomes a bit less of an issue.\\nThe amount of slots you get for equipment is also very limited. While it isn\\'t so bad with weapon and sentinel slots, you get only two Warframe slots for starters, kind of limiting your options as to how many roles you can fill in a team. You really need more slots to be able to do something besides one or two things.\\nThe last thing is the fact that the game is pretty glitchy. Objects can spawn at wrong places due to random generator just messing up, or you can land outside the map and fall into the Void to a collision detection glitch or a lag spike. And this isn\\'t an uncommon occurence.\\nOverall, this is a grindy and harsh at the beginning, but very fun game once you get far enough. You should check it out if you don\\'t mind a sluggish beginning, especially if you\\'ve got more experienced friends who can help you get running.',\n",

       " 'Caution: Overly detailed, so I am very sorry\\n      So I\\'ve been playing this game for about 3 years now, and this has easily become one of my most played games that I own. Not even exclusive to steam. Warframe is a game that takes place in space, where you take control of a \\'Tenno\\', which is the faction/race of everyone else that plays. What is a Tenno? Well... play for yourself, and you\\'ll find out with time. -wink-\\n\"What is a Warframe?\"\\n      Warframes are the battle-suits that you control. You walk as them, you fight as them, you hang out as them...you pretty much ARE the Warframe. (Yes, I told you that you are a Tenno as well. Like I said, it\\'s just a suit. It\\'s complicated.) There are currently 29 different Warframes to collect/build and use, each with their own unique set of flashy abilities. I say \\'currently\\' because the development team behind this game are constantly working on it and sending out updates (also, one of the most enjoyable development teams I\\'ve ever seen, tbh), and the community helps shape the game greatly. \\n      Anyhow, the Warframes are battle-suits for a reason. In this game, you are a freaking ninja, in probably the most ninja way possible. From wall jumps, slides, air-kicks, backflips, gliding, rolling, super jumps, throwing stars, dual daggers, etc.. You name it, it\\'s probably possible. There is so much movement and control, you can fly through areas like a breeze if you get the hang of the movement system. There is also so much customization in this game. Assault rifles, rocket launchers, bows, crossbows, sniper rifles, shotguns, laser-beams, sawblade launchers, wormhole creators, grenade launchers, laser cannons, lightning shooters, gas cloud launchers, laser-rifles, infested growth that shoots bullets and grappling hooks, freeze-rays, and much more. Also, most of what I just listed are primary weapons, meaning you ALSO have secondary weapons, which are your sidearms, and melee weapons. There are an equal amount of interesting categories for sidearms, but if you are an in-your-face type of player, then enjoy your collection of melee weapons, including single swords, dual swords, katanas, daggers, glaives, bo staffs, polearms, hammers, axes, whips, whip/blade combos, energy-blades--well, you get the point by now. There are many skins for your weapons and your warframes as well. Another thing that heavily affects customization is the fact that you can color anything that you own, from warframes, weapons, companions (little robotic fellows that float behind you with their own supportive abilities..or, you know, a cat or a dog.), armor pieces and scarfs (this game is called Fashionframe by the community for a reason), and even your own ship.\\n      Your ship serves as your personal hub, where you can access the star chart for missions, your arsenal, your foundry (for building weapons, warframes, gear, and everything else), your mods, and more. What are mods? Mods are these little cards that drop from enemies in the game, some mods being specific to certain enemies. They also have tiers of rarity. Anyway, mods are a very important feature, and are used for upgrading your warframes and weapons. There are hundreds of different mods, ranging from additional health percentages, additional damage, elemental damage (which you can mix different elements to form new elements, might I add), ability range, and just...pretty much anything you need to help you progress and spice up the gameplay a bit more. Want a silenced loadout for stealth? There are mods for that. Screw stealth, you want explosions? Mods.\\n\"Who are the bad guys?\"\\n      There are a handful of different factions in the game, mostly all of them against the Tenno. \\nThere are the Grineer, who are crude, ugly, bulky clones of other Grineer, made to produce a massive army. Usually found in their battleships, or their own settlements, destroying the planet\\'s landscape with machinery. They look dumb, but can be pretty tough.\\n      Another faction is the Corpus, who are driven by greed. They are more technologically advanced than the Grineer, using robotics, drones, and lasers in their favor. \\n      The Infested is another faction. They are...a bit of a mess. Disgusting heaps and masses of flesh, screeching as they charge to attack. They are basically zombified, destroyed forms of Grineer and Corpus, but you really don\\'t see them that way, considering how mutilated they become. They don\\'t have much of a role other than to spread the virus, and, most importantly, kill you.\\n      There are a couple of other factions, but they are a bit spoiler-y, so I\\'ll avoid talking about them.\\n\"Why are we doing any of this in the first place?\"\\n      Because Space-mom tells you to, and you must listen to Space-mom.\\n\"....who tf is space-mom?\"\\n      Upon the Tenno\\'s awakening, you are contacted by a mysterious woman by the name of Lotus, who first appears to be an AI of sorts, although taking a humanoid form. You have no memory of anything before this \\'awakening\\', so you should probably listen to her.\\n      She guides and cares for the entire Tenno faction, alerting them of dangers and important events happening throughout the solar system. She is your leader.\\n\"So what is the main objective, overall?\" +bonus info i dont know where to fit otherwise\\n      Really, it\\'s anything you want. A lot of players get lost because they don\\'t know what they should be doing, but you are just supposed to make your own personal missions, which you can invite friends to. Also, this is a very heavy co-op based game, so have as much fun as you want with up to 4 players in a squad (or up to 8 in raid missions). You can play this game completely solo if you want, of course. It will be pretty challenging, though.\\n      So let\\'s start from a new players point-of-view. You have unlocked your first planet. You can continue to do the mission-nodes that it has to offer, all the way up to the planet boss. Each planet also has a newly-added feature, which are known as Junctions. Junctions are what players have to go through to get to the next planet, and will offer a variety of trials before passage. Upon completing a Junction, you are rewarded with a few things, such as blueprints for weapons, a few parts for building a few specific warframes, and they will unlock quests. Quests are side-things that you can do, which also give you some rewards. There are a handful of warframes that are quest-exclusive if you want to obtain them, as well as some helpful items to assist you along the way. Another recent addition (as in since December) are Cinematic Quests. These are main story-related quests that have cutscenes, and usually have a lot to reveal about the lore, and will unlock some other nice things (You still have to unlock these quests from Junctions, or even just through the market.) The in-game market shows mostly all of everything you can get in the game. The best part? You can get most of this for free! Of course you can add money to just BUY weapons, warframes, gear, companions, etc., and gain access to them immediately, but this is not a pay-to-win game. Not at all. It\\'s more of a \\'pay-to-progress-faster\\' game. However, building these things by yourself without paying any real currency can be a fun time-consuming process. The word Fun can be taken literally or sarcastically in this subject, depending on what the building requirements are, for what you are making. You gather resources to build and complete these things from different planets throughout the solar system, each having their own set of different resources. They drop from enemies, loot lockers, and storage containers (there is even a warframe that increases loot drops, while simutaneously punching souls and raising the dead!). Also, you can earn the real-money currency in this game by trading with other players. I\\'m out of space at this point, but all I have to say is I wish more of my friends could get into this.',\n",

       " 'I find myself in a rather strange position with Warframe. Normally, with a FOP game I immediately come into the game with ill feeling on the grounds that most of their kind are not consumer friendly, and are devised to extort as much money from the player as possible. However, if one is wise to the internet community at all, one will have noticed the general feeling towards this game has always been rather favorable. The developers, despite some rather hefty resource requirements (The Hema\\'s building schematic, for example, is insane, and designed to produce frustration to make people buy it outright) will usually be attainable easily enough. \\nSecondly, I would also like to preface the fact that this game is constantly changing and being updated. Nerfs, bug fixes, new weapons and Frames, and the like are constantly being added to the game. Hence, discussing the micro scales subtitles is almost useless as its subject to change. With that said, on with the review.\\nAt first you might find the movement in Warframe clumsy and \\'floaty\\'. You\\'ll soon get used to it, I found myself diving through small holes in the environment and shooting peoples while flying through the air in a matter of hours. A caveat however, is that you will find the quickest way to traverse the environment is to the [Slide+jump+role] maneuver, and repeat it forever. This looks slightly strange when you see everyone (including yourself) pirouetting through the mission, but it gets you from A to B quick. \\nThe combat however is great. Most weapons feel distinct with their own personality and a wealth of mods and extra do-hikkys to add onto them. Most weapons have significant punch to them, the shotguns especially, but some, the pistols especially, seem to mere pee-shooters in comparison to their larger primary-arm. Melee is also great (As of \"Combat.20).Most weapons have combo\\'s to pull off, or you can simply mash the E button and turn your enemies to pulp, but more importantly, you\\'ll still look good while doing it.\\nYou sensing a theme here?\\nYes. This game is made to forfill your deepest power fantasy. While the games \"End game\" Sorties are high enough level to cause you some discomfort, most of the game is a breeze. The completionist aspect will keep you coming back again and again, if you\\'re of the inclination to enjoy that sort of game however.\\nIts ok. \\nNot the best thing about the game by a long shot. Soundtrack is background filler at best. Some OST\\'s are ok, but rarely intrude onto the on-screen carnage. Weapon sounds however, do a good job of conferring the heavy crunches and meaty explosions of some truly ridiculous firearms exploded your foes into bloody giblets. \\nThis section will of the review will be more subjective that the others, purely on the grounds that some will not have such a tolerance for the grind as some.  With that said, I did not find the grind in this game to be overly-intrusive. If you set your mind to it there is nothing in the game you cannot grind out in a matter of hours (Apart from some late game Prime parts). Most resources are easily obtainable, but a certain amount of RNG is involved. Each planet you visit will indicate what kind of resource you can expect to find, but I would advise looking up the drop-tables just for ease of life. \\nIn many ways, Warframe sets the frame work for all \\'Free to Play\\' games. Satisfying gameplay loop, with reasonable end-game combat. The grind is manageable, and what you don\\'t what to grind for you can buy. The ingame currency might not appeal to you on the grounds that things appear ludicrously expensive. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING UNTIL YOU HAVE THE 75% OFF COUPON CODE (It drops on the daily login reward). That makes the most expensive ingame currency package (something like £130) into a more managed £35; a reasonable price considering that gains you about 4500 platinum, which will last you for a long-long time. \\nIf you\\'re looking to sink some time into a great game, which just so happens to be almost free, you\\'d might as well choose this one.',\n",

       " \"Warframe's relaxed take on third person combat, impressive visuals, and vast combat customization lets it appeal to both hardcore gamers as well as weekend warriors. Latency issues and high system requirements can put off many but its free to play model is fair. All of the content is provided to players free of charge and that makes it difficult not to recommend it to everyone. \\nYou assume the role of one of the Tenno; an ancient group of warriors that were placed in cryogenic stasis in order to survive a losing war.Your character then awakens to find the solar system in extreme turmoil. Caught in a war between three major factions and being the only ones able to disrupt the stalemate, they soon attract attention. Awoken and lead by a mysterious identity going by the alias “Lotus” the Tenno's intentions continue to remain unknown.\\nWarframe's third person combat is simple but refined, providing a very relaxed and smooth shoot-'em-up feel, while a complex but easy to follow weapon modification system offers endless customization to the gameplay. Enemies will drop many modifications during missions, which allow players to change weaponry and their character to improve combat performance without limitation. This design allows players to modify all of the smallest aspects of their character and weaponry while maintaining the game’s RPG elements. Each of the weapons have their own specific function, attack patterns and style, which further compliment your playstyle. Dying can come across as cheap as some enemies will stun lock players to death or simply hit through their shields for an instant-kill. Included to increase difficulty; it often feels unjustified and overly punishing.\\nMission maps are generated randomly based on pre-existing tile sets depending on the planet and type of mission chosen. Each mission has a specific objective, however many of these feel overly similar; often consisting of back tracking and repetitive fetch quests.  Missions are unlocked by completing the adjacent nodes connected to them; however this soon branches off into many directions, though many of these use the same tile-sets as the previous mission with only a few varying objectives between the two. Missions can often feel too similar to one another on a single planet, giving little reason to play ones that branch away from the main path.\\nThe matchmaking system can be frustrating, offering little choice in terms of selecting a mission or joining a game already in progress. Offering no options besides public or private, you may often find yourself leaving a laggy game only to be thrown back in again numerous times. The matchmaking system definitely needs work and it’s constantly overlooked throughout updates.\\nWarframe's free to play model uses micro-transactions to speed up the acquisition of weapons and characters with the use of in game currency called platinum. Free users are still able to access all content within the game but will struggle to gain access to everything without consistent farming for materials and parts needed to create new weapons. Platinum allows players to directly purchase weapons and characters without the need to craft and collect materials. With free players able to access all content while giving paying customers faster access to new content, Warframe shows how the free to play model doesn’t have to alienate non-paying users.\\nWhile Warframe doesn't provide the adrenaline fueled action we're accustomed to in shooters, its Shoot-'em-up style combat remains satisfying for many hours and the endless customization options add much needed padding to help overcome the repetition. The heavy reliance on a random loot table for item drops throughout the game can lead to extreme frustration at times, especially when farming for a specific item. Bugs can be prominent at times, especially the ones that affect the user interface, however most major issues are fixed quickly with a hotfix provided by the development team.\\nPros:\\n+ Stunning visuals, especially for more powerful video cards\\n+ Plenty of weapons and characters to level up\\n+ Customization allows any type of design and play-style which adds replay value\\n+ Frequent content updates\\nCons:\\n- Dying can feel unfair at times, leaving the player stun-locked until death\\n- Matchmaking system needs work, often selecting poor hosts\\n- High repetition within missions\\n- High system requirements\\n- Microtransactions are a little overpriced\\nWhile rough around the edges at times, most bugs and technical issues are not persistent. As long as you can meet the system requirements and bandwidth isn't a limitation, there’s no reason not to give Warframe a try with its fair free to play model.\\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out the Analog Reviews steam group where we strive to provide honest and unbiased reviews: \",\n",

Classes do not exist and are instead replaced by an equally wide variety of frames that can perform a wide variety of abilities, making player loadout customisation vast almost to the point of being intimidating. The combat feels great, and once you find a frame and weapon load out that you enjoy, there\\'s enough of a learning curve still present that allows you to master your chosen loadout to the best effectiveness.\\nLoadout is further customised by modifications you can apply to both frame and weapons, also known as mods, but I praise this system a little less heartily than I praise the actual variety of frames and weapons.\\nThe game boasts a beautiful soundtrack and some stunning cutscenes in the story missions that have been added over the last couple of years, and the story is surprisingly immersive for a game of this style. Speaking as somebody who enjoys lore and story in video games, it was a \\n surprise to play through the Warframe story quests and learn more about the universe that DE have created here; there\\'s a surprising amount of depth to it that lorehounds can dig into and theorycraft about. The voice acting is also surprisingly good, all things considered, although you could also call it a little \"cheesey\" or \"hammy\" in places - a little overdone. Bosses are given notably memorable personalities, in my opinion, and they\\'re fun to \\'interract\\' with. \\nEvents are fairly regular and there are a variety of mission types, although generally the mission types do blend together in places given the combat is the main focal point of the game. Enemy types are also varied, but only really noticeable when you get to end-game content and you learn to prioritise which enemy you should kill first for your own safety; at early levels you won\\'t really notice a difference between different enemies as you cut through them all the same. Different planets are made to feel somewhat unique with varying tilesets, which also gives Warframe the ability to make every mission \\n individual insofar as the layout of your tileset will be randomly generated with every playthrough and you will not learn to route missions more than you will learn to map out each tile in a given set until it becomes second nature navigating through them.\\nBoss fights exist in the game and vary from being somewhat frustrating to being interesting and fun; sadly while I enjoyed almost all boss fights the first couple of times they quickly began to blend together into simple \"special enemies\" that needed a bit of care or a specific loadout to steamroll over. This can be said about much of the Warframe content.\\n1. Although there are hundreds of mods to choose from for frames, weapons and companions, this is actually quite deceitful. While you can modify your loadout in any way you see fit, you will quickly come to learn that specific frames perform to the best of their ability with specific loadouts - and this is the same for weapons and companions. The vast mod system becomes quickly smaller when you realise that certain mods are required for your frame or your weapon and you will always be dedicating one or two slots per frame/weapon/companion for the same one or two mods, without fail.\\nWhile there is still a great deal of customisation to be had, it\\'s quickly apparent that there are some things you will be required or expected to have equipped to your loadout to better your performance.\\n2. Certain frames are simply not as good as other frames. Now this isn\\'t to say you shouldn\\'t play them if you enjoy them; every frame can be played to the endgame and you should play frames that you enjoy. But it is quickly apparent when you start playing with different frames that some just don\\'t offer anything decent, or don\\'t do a job that another frame does not do better. This leaves some frames feeling gimicky or otherwise less fun to play given how less effective they are by comparison, and it certainly can make you feel a little out of place if you choose to play publicly when you take an unconventional frame.\\nFor those who don\\'t care about public opinion, this won\\'t seem like an issue. But, for players who care about efficiency and effectiveness, this is an issue you should likely be aware of before you choose to invest in certain frames.\\n3. Warframe is infamous for its grind. Progression in Warframe does not follow skinner box logic simply because there are very few noticeable changes when ranking up anything from 1 - 30. Aside from frames getting new abilities and getting increased mod capacity across the board, gameplay itself does not feel \\n changed because as you continue to rank up, you play missions designed for higher ranks and thus the game remains the same. There are no notable jumps in power that leave you feeling particularly empowered as a player and, if anything, playing a new weapon or warframe is more satisfying than grinding them to rank 30 simply because they bring you something new to do.\\nFarming for Prime parts - where a Primed version of a frame or a weapon is more powerful than its counterpart - has recently been completely overhauled with a new Relic and Fissure system, where you are required to grind out relics that contain potential Prime parts and then required to complete Fissure missions in order to break them open. Endless missions - a staple of the Warframe \"endgame\" that featured a steadily scaling mission that players with fully ranked and kitted loadouts could challenge themselves with - have been recently \\'reworked\\' to the point of being playable but still requiring a additional relic for every 5 waves, meaning there is still a greater grind for farming Primes than there was previously.\\nMastery Rank is given more attention than it should be given, but it is a requirement to unlock and craft certain weapons, so it is also worth mentioning that you will be required to get and rank multiple frames and weapons to 30 in order to progress your Mastery Rank and unlock further content - which can also mean grinding a weapon to 30 you otherwise hate playing and would never use.\\n4. For a game with so many frames and weapons, the number of slots you have for frames and weapons is hilariously small. Naturally Warframe is free to play and thus there is encouragement to purchase Platinum - the in game currency you buy for real money - so that you can expand your arsenal and have greater access to weapons and frames. While normally I wouldn\\'t chastise this business model, in this case I chastise it simply due to how necessary it winds up being, unless you don\\'t mind being a minimalist and being extremely picky with what you keep and what you sell after you rank it to 30. For hoarders like myself, it\\'s a nightmare.',\n",

The game was horribly optimized then, but it was worth it because it was fun when it did work and you knew that the devs were working on it with the amount of patches being released. They slowed down for a while, which I figured was to prepare for the game's launch (which I believe was originally scheduled in June of this year). Now, however, it's clear that this game has gone from a promising alpha game to another game that has gone from promising game in development to cash grab. I've seen significant performance drops since the desert xpac came out, on top of numerous bugs that had been plaguing the base game before its release. I was really looking forward to this game fully polished, if it was this fun with bugs and performance issues, imagine being able to run it at full quality.

This game completely makes you forget about all of that.\\nThey have turned this game into a Community Driven MMO, recently adding in Steam Workshop Support to let the fans themselves contribute towards the game\\'s content available. And even before that, they have taken several fan-created Warframes and Weapons and put them into the game today. Some examples of this being the Mios Blade & Whiip, the Silva & Aegis Flame Sword & Shield, and even the Zephyr Warframe.\\nThe Free 2 Play Aspect of this game is an absolute GODSEND, and every single other MMO out there should look at Warframe as a good example of how to do a Free 2 Play MMO done right in a 100% Non-P2W Fashion. Oh, you wanna buy that really powerful gun at such a low rank just to compete with the big boys? TOUGH♥♥♥♥♥♥ scrub!

Of course, you\\'re still ALLOWED to spend moeny on tthe game if you want, but at absolutely no point do you feel like you\\'re being FORCED to do so whatsoever.\\nTired of people in League of Legends and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive telling you how they\\'re going to♥♥♥♥♥♥your mother right in front of you in public all because you didn\\'t do as well as you should have ingame? Well I\\'ve got some good news for you! Warframe\\'s community is nothing short of AMAZING. If you ask a question about ANYTHING in the Region Chat, you are guaranteed to get a helpful response back from multiple people. There\\'s even an entirely separate chat called the Recruit Chat in which you can literally ask for help if you\\'re having difficulty accomplishing something. Ontop of that, Digital Extremes themselves regularly have Livestreams where they interact with the fanbase of the game itself; in which they give out Free 1000 Platinum OR a Legendary Fusion Core to people regularly when these livestreams occur every couple of weeks.\\nNow what of the Gameplay? Well, the best way to describe this game quickly is with one 3 word sentence:\\nDESTINY DONE RIGHT.\\nThis game has a similar concept to how Destiny\\'s gameplay was setting itself up to be, but it literally fixes EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM that Destiny has within the 1st 10-15 minutes of playing the game for your first time. You will NEVER EVER hear the words \"There\\'s no time to explain why I have no time to explain\" out of ANYONE\\'S MOUTH in this entire game. The storytelling of this game, while still a WIP as of this review, has only gotten Better and Better. Especially after the release of Update 18, which completely changed the way everyone percieved Warframes and the Tenno forever. The Second Dream quest that came with that update didn\\'t even feel like a quest. After you finish it, it feels like you just walked out of threater after watching A GREAT MOVIE. The Lore of Warframe has only gotten better and better as the updates came through, and I can\\'t wait to see more now that Digital Extremes got themselves a brand new Motion Capture Studio for themselves to make Animated CG Cutscenes.\\nCombat is divided into both PvP and PvE, but the main focus of the game is primarily on the PvE side of things, with PvP being an Optional Game Mode that has completely different rules and regulations from the PvE part of the game entirely. The gameplay itself is a mix of a variety of different gameplay types in one. Hardcore Parkour + MOBA + Third Person Shooter + Hack & Slash + Stealth ALL IN ONE GAME. That\\'s Warframe\\'s Gameplay in a nutshell. It lets you choose how you wanna play your game. Do you wanna go Balls-Out Guns-A-Blazing? Go for it! Do you wanna go in all Sneaky-Like and go Stealth? Go right ahead! As for the MOBA part, that\\'s where the Warframes themselves come into play to describe that one. Each Warframe has 3 Special Abilities and 1 Ultimate Ability; and sometimes even a Passive Ability as well, depending on the Warframe. This formula has been used constantly amongst MOBAs like League of Legends and DotA 2, and it\\'s also used here as well. And with this game, it works perfectly. Each Warframe plays different from one another, and no Warframe feels the same as the other does. Granted, certain Warframes need to be updated and reworked; as of this Review. But Digital Extremes will definitely get around to it. Some Warframes that are in desperate need of a rework at this time are Warframes such as Mag, Volt, Oberon, and Nekros; as examples. But again, DE will get around to them eventually. Mag and Volt are already confirmed to be getting reworked even as I type this review out right now. As for the Warframe Combat itself, that\\'s where things get fun. All the Guns and Melee Weapons in the game are fully customizable with an In-Depth Mod System to add stats and buffs to your weapons exactly the way you see fit for your style of play. The game allows you to have 3 Mod Loadouts, listed as \"Config A\", \"Config B\", and \"Config C\". And you can switch them on the fly right before each mission so you know exactly which loadout to go with for each enemy faction in the game.\\nNow what about Character Customization? Lemme tell you, this game went ♥♥♥♥ing ALL OUT with that one. If there\\'s was a word to describe Warframe, it would be \"Pay 2 Bling\". The majority of the♥♥♥♥♥♥you buy with Platinum and Steam Wallet Funds are all purely Aesthetics. And there is a HELL OF A LOT to choose from. Dozens of Color Pallets, Syandana Scarfs, Armor Platings, etc.... You can make your Warframe as badass-looking as you want it to be.\\nAnd of course, Archwing. How could I forget about Archwing? Now to be fair, this is one of the more \"Heavy WIP\" Gamemodes that Warframe has, but even right now, it\\'s still FUN AS HELL to play. Flying through space with a Winged Jetpack strapped on your♥♥♥♥♥at Mach 1 Speeds is fast-paced and feels like you\\'re playing Zone of the Enders in a way. But as I said before, this type of gameplay is Heavy WIP, and there still is a lot more to be done wiith it to polish it up. Mobile Defense and Defense Missions need to be completely reworked, and Environments need to be a bit more varied. Ontop of that, the enemies are a bit bugged right now AND the Variety of Archwings and Weapons needs serious work. Right now, the Itzal Archwing is overpowered so badly to the point where it outclasses literally every other Archwing in the game by a large margin. But I\\'m sure DE will fix it eventually.\\nThe bottom line here is this:\\nThis game is absolutely amazing for so many reasons. It is a milestone with the Free 2 Play MMO Market, and should be set highly as an example of how to do a Free 2 Play System done right. And the gameplay is absolutely fantastic. When they said \"Ninjas Play Free\", Digital Extremes was NOT KIDDING. This game is the True Definition of what Free 2 Play should be like for Every Free MMO out there.\\nWtf are you still reading this for?! Go and play this game! Do it!',\n",
       " \"Warframe is a fast-paced third person shooter. The developer, Digital Extremes, is the studio behind The Darkness 2 and Dark Sector. Digital Extremes gets involved with the community, by providing regular patches, video updates and participation in the forums. Digital Extremes borrows heavily from their previous game Dark Sector that was developed in 2008 and scrapped on 2012 in favor of making Warframe.\\n+Great Atmosphere/Environments\\n+Great Weapon/Skills/Character Selection\\n+Great Clan System (Dojo is impressive)\\n+Great Developer Support(updates are good chunks and come often)\\n+Great movement opportunities(Running across wall is fun)\\n-Grind(Blueprints/Materials)\\n The gameplay is pretty solid, if you are looking something flashy like Devil May Cry, you are not going to get it here. That being said, the variation of weapons really make up for this. The warframes themselves are great in terms of variety and design. Each one has stats and abilities that set them apart, which results in a fresh experience every time you play with a new warframe.  Being able to run along walls or run up them makes mobility in the game more dynamic in terms of getting from point A to point B.\\nRank system emphasis on developing experience with Warframes, weapons and equipment rather than getting exp in general. Your rank is a signature of how much firepower you have accumulated in your arsenal. \\nSince rank challenges vary it will test a wide array of your skills from marksmanship, mobility, and combat abilities. This system results in the player being more well rounded by fleshing out your skills in a multitude of areas.\\nUpgrading, transmuting, and fusion are several methods to improve your options. The level of equipment acts as points for attaching mods. This allows for multiple combinations of mods to get different desired advantages, to fight certain factions or missions.  \\nThe forma is also a great way to make a weapon use less points in certain slots allowing you to develop it even further. \\nThe setting is great and in my opinion helped attract alot of people to this game. The atmosphere and level designs are becoming more varied as the developers are updating the game with new environments. The new environments are really fun to play in and sometimes have their own perks. \\nAs someone who made a long guide for this game I can say that their updates are so solid I feel my guide gets outdated every month and requires me to go back and make it relevant. This is most apparent in their UI changes they have made which made my videos a-bit weird to see for the newer players. \\nThe dojo is one of the nicest additions I have seen yet. Not only does it offer a nice place for members to go to but in a sense its structure is an achievement of everyone who has helped contribute to it. The dojo offers a wide variety of nice side things like being able to do pvp, and being able to craft new weapons that are only available through research. \\nIf you are worried about this game being pay to win rest assured that’s not how it is. The only real benefit to paying besides cosmetics is being able to get slots. You can put time in and get the same results you just can't have many Warframes/Weapons at once. They also designed it in a way that is hybrid in some areas. For example in foundry you will be able to pay money to speed up the process. So instead of buying the weapon, you can collect the resources, craft the item in foundry and then pay to speed up the process so you don't have to wait. \\nYes, there is grinding when you are looking for specific warframes and materials. Generally you will grind in the places where you reap the most benefits and try to get the pay-off aka the warframe as soon as possible. The grinding got a bit worse in a way when they introduced more materials which made the chances lower of getting blueprints. This is setoff a bit by the fact that they introduced alot more environment maps which increase its replayability. So if you do not mind grinding, buy slots to make more warframes if you like the game enough.\\nOverall Warframe is a classic example of how free to play games can be great and interesting and still give developers plenty of profits without turning it into a Pay to Win game. If you are looking for an interesting game.... just give it a try, I am sure it won't disappoint.\",\n",

Has a decent, high octane combat system. It\\'s a great power fantasy game, extremely fun. Gets a bit boring and grindy because you have to farm materials and pieces of gear based on RNG.\\nI personally don\\'t feel like the Devs listen or care much. They\\'ve made many changes I\\'m not a fan of (In fact, I know a few people who hate the changes more than I do.), and if I ever go back to the game? I refuse to spend another cent on it.\\nAlso, the community drama scene on Youtube with a certain Youtuber who I can\\'t name because Digital Extremes often ban people just for even mentioning his name, being associated with him, or whatever.  Just shows how corrupt the developers are since they banned him for doing stuff that their Youtube partners do all of the time, yet they don\\'t get banned. One of them even said on Stream that his fans and the other Warframe YT partners should send a hate mob to this unnamed YT\\'rs channel. Of course, after he got called out on this (Probably got a finger wagging from Digital Extremes), he tried to take down all evidence of the stream. Classy.\\nOh, and new content becomes increasingly more difficult to get, as well as suffers from power creepage.\\nAn example: A lot of the new Warframes and weapons require this stuff called Nitain extract. You often need a lot of this stuff just to build this new content, but you can only get it when a mission has been modified into a special kind of mission (Kind of like how it works with the new Relic system) called \"Alert Missions\" which only pop up for a few minutes or hours, depending. \\nWhilst I used to just buy the new stuff since I hate farming, my friends would often complain about how irritating it is to get Nitain simply because the alerts randomly decide when you\\'re allowed to obtain it. You would often need a lot of it too, from my limited understanding, and that\\'s just ♥♥♥♥♥♥. \\nThe game also lacks endgame content. Once you have everything, there\\'s just nothing to do other than help friends grind for the stuff that you got before them or w/e. This game will get boring very fast for you if you\\'ve sunk a lot of time and/or money into it.\\n*EDIT*\\nI should mention the new prime part system, in my opinion? Sucks.\\nIt used to be that you would do a level that needed an easy to get key, getting the key and finishing the levels wasn\\'t hard nor did it ever take long. When you finished the level, you would randomly get either a prime part, blueprints, or rare materials based on RNG rolls.\\nNow? You have to get these stupid relic keys, wait for an alert (kind of like Nitain) that has the class/level of relic that you need for the part that is in the specific drop table that the relic has. THEN you have to not only complete the standard level in its entirety, but you also have to do an annoying and needlessly finnicky minigame where you kill waves of enemies until you grab enough orb things to unlock the relic.  Needless change. \\nThe only good thing about the changes in this is that everyone usually gets different parts, and if a squadmate gets something you wanted, but you got something nobody in your squad wanted, you can pick what your squadmate got for free, and he/she would still get their own copy.\\n*END OF EDIT*\\nI don\\'t mind if you love this game, or hate my review. I\\'m probably gonna regret writing this. But, meh. \\nThis isn\\'t really me trying to say \"Don\\'t play this game\", more so explaining why I\\'ve quit.\\nAnd if it does influence you into not playing this game, or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me for my opinions, then so be it.',\n",
       " 'With nearly a quarter of a million reviews at the time of posting, it\\'s hard to say anything about Warframe that hasn\\'t already been said. Warframe is frightfully addictive, and once you get over the initial wall of \"What the hell is going on\", it can be very hard to put it back down. So many of the negative reviews on Steam consist of \"The game has changed\" or \"It ruined my life\" and, when you\\'ve sunk so many hundreds of hours into a game, I find it somewhat insulting that some people still choose to leave negative reviews on a free game. That\\'s not to say Warframe is faultless, but after earning hundreds of hours of your time, it feels like you must\\'ve enjoyed the game at some point.\\nWarframe is a third person hacky/slashy shooter set in space with robot-like ninjas. That sentence is about as awesome as playing the game, and the combat is incredibly satisfyting once you get the hang of it (and a few decent weapons). Many of the characters feel unique, albeit with some redundant characters (frames) cluttering up what could be (and still is mostly) an impressively diverse roster (The same applies to weaponry too). \\nMissions go through small instances in teams of 1-4 to complete certain objectives, whether it be rescuing a target, eliminating hostiles or defending a point. All missions are \"somewhat\" procedurally generated bar the story missions. By \"Somewhat\", I mean \"You\\'ll start to recognise each room a ton, but they can pop up in any order and multiple times\". I can practically recall every room you can find on \"Pluto Excavation: Hierarchon\", since that particular mission has taken more hours from me than some entire games have.\\nBut I digress, Warframe is enjoyable... on three conditions:\\n- Excercise some self-control - Those without willpower may find themselves completely sucked into the world of Warframe. Wallets may empty and lives may crumble. It harkens back to the days of Everquest and the whole \"Whoops, I was mid-raid and forgot to feed my baby.\" So... self-control guys.\\n- Set your own goals - Those who need a game to tell them exactly what to do will struggle with Warframe. Besides a few story missions that will take a few hours, getting strong enough to take them on will require hours of working on building your arsenal through modding your frames and weapons or acquiring new ones. This takes time and, without a sense of direction, I can see players simply going through missions one by one and getting frustrated by difficulty or repetition quickly. Chill out, pick a gun, bow, sword or whatever, and just work towards it. It\\'s a slow but rewarding process.\\n- Bring or find some friends - Warframe can be a lonely place, even in groups, if you have no-one to talk to in a one hour defence mission. Having some people to laugh with, work with and rage with against GOD DAMN LECH KRIL WHY IS HIS HIT BOX FOR HIS THING SO TINY AAAAH will help immensely.\\nThis game is full of potential. A way to earn the supposedly \"P2W\" currency through trading, Bosses, Raids, Pets, Secret powers, this game has it all. As long as you love doing sweet flips off walls, shooting guys in mid-air and can keep yourself from going mad, this game is potentially timesink gold for anyone looking for a new game to keep themselves occupied.\\nWarframe is great. It\\'s eaten more hours than any game I\\'ve ever played on Steam and I can forsee it taking more as they continue to update this already vast game. It\\'s worth your time to at least give it a few hours. It\\'s free, after all, so why not?',\n",
       " 'Oh boy.\\nWarframe\\'s not a typical MMO. It\\'s a squad based third person shooter set in the FAR future. You, the player, are of the Tenno faction, commanding Warframes under the guideance of the Lotus. Aka: Space Mom. The other factions of the game, which can be your ally one moment, foe the next, are the cloned disasters Grineer, with their levels and design of armor and weapons designed around metal and machinery. Their goal is to one day find a cure for their species, which rapidly degrade due to the cloning process. The Corpus, their rival faction, is all about tech and greed. They\\'re smart. Sly. Always send robots to do their jobs. Credits (the in game currency) are their first and last prize, hardly joining in commadery. Dominating the market, even joining all sides of a war to make trade while at war with them is their buisness. The Orokin, The Infested, and The Sentients...well, they\\'re secretive, bizzare, and supposedly long gone.\\nUnlike a lot of F2P MMOs, their \"premium currency\" can be obtained through trading with other players. While the game can\\'t be considered \"pay 2 win\" due to the extreme focus on Co-Op gameplay, it\\'s diminished a little due to the existance of the Conclave, the PVP enviorment. It\\'s completely reasonable to ignore this mode as, well, there\\'s no forced reason apon one to play it. I for one tried a few rounds, and that\\'s all. It\\'s community is the complete opposite of Warframe\\'s normal side. It\\'s incredibly toxic, even in the team based PVP.\\nThe normal parts of the game can get really chaotic. Your main goal in the game, really, can be many things. From hoarding every piece of equipment, right down to scanning everything in a massive lorehunt. Players are technically overpowered, and will pretty much always be this way. You\\'re a metal ninja with stuff straight out of magic, defying the laws of gravity, even create Limbo in a area!\\nThe combat\\'s pretty fun. If you\\'re a fan of being moble, you\\'re going to love this game. Even if you play Rhino, the typical tank \"Frame\" (playable character) can still run on walls, hop up walls, hang onto them, superjump, even have mid-air bullettime! Later levels and planets in the game can get absolutely insane with the number of mobs from the many factions. Nothing ever feels as good as firing two rounds of a shotgun with radiated fire bullets and have it\\'s ultimate skill send off a AOE that melts away armor and just makes everything explode. Loot flying everywhere!\\nThere\\'s a problem with the loot, though, that can push people away. It\\'s timed. Weapons can take from several hours to a full day to craft. On top of this, you need to farm for materials to craft them to begin with. Platnium can come in to speed up the process, so it has the feeling of the typical, bad facebook game. ESPECIALLY when it comes to the THREE day wait on new frames once you\\'ve finished the parts. If anything, you should save platnium for these times.\\nThankfully, this game doesn\\'t force any kind of \"Membership\" status down your throat. There\\'s no levels in the game locked off with money. Only in your skill and equipment, clearing level after level to unlock the planets you need.\\nThe enviorments, I feel, have the most love out of anything else in the game. Lush forests overtaking machinery, outer space filled with astroid and ship debree, underwater combat, infected ships and planets...Deserts, snowy reigons..There\\'s a lot to see, here.\\nThe game also doesn\\'t take too much to actually play. I can\\'t play Fallout 4, I can just barely play Injustice, but I can easilly run this game on around medium settings.\\nBeware, the game IS a grind. If you have time, you will be having that time spent farming and fighting. RNG can bless you, or hate you as you try to grind for the same item for weeks.\\nIf you\\'re still interested in Warframe, go for it! It IS free! I reccomend it overall!',\n",

       " \"I have a severe love hate relationship with warframe, it’s a long read tldr at the bottom\\nI’m a “grandmaster founder”, I’ve been playing off and on since the beginning of 2013 and I’ve seen just how different the games changed for better and for worse.\\nYou play in third person, as a warframe a “space ninja” where you kill everything in your way with a ton of different weapons or abilities as you chase the green finish line mark on your map, this gives you loot, you use the loot to craft more toys and the process repeats; this can either be done solo or with up to three more people for a total of four.\\nTo keep this relatively simple here is what I like about warframe\\n•\\tWarframe’s art is unique and many people spend huge amounts of time coloring their gear, between picking a frame, what three weapons it’ll use and then what it’ll wear almost turns into a dress up game all on its own. The levels look great and get better each time the dev’s take a look at them usually adding new effects and rooms to fight in. The enemies you fight (while kinda stale) all look good and can be cut into pieces, burnt to ashes, melted, electrocuted, smashed into the distance or frozen which while not anything groundbreaking, does lead to some memorable moments.\\n•\\tWarframe’s combat is fast paced and varied in what you can use to fight your way through hordes of soldiers, robots, or space zombies. Jumping ahead at what feels like 60 mph to swing a great sword at the head of some poor sob never really seemed to lose its appeal.\\n•\\tWarframes payment scheme is mostly pretty forgiving, you can earn things in-game by working for them, if you want them quicker there’s always the option of tossing some money at the screen.\\nUnfortunately these two areas are all that really shined for me, some things to think about before you jump into the game.\\n•\\tWarframe hardly ever tries to explain itself to new players. A game where the wiki is more helpful than the tutorial. Fortunately the community loves to take newer players under their wings. However when new mechanics are introduced the players are on their own to figure it out or get help from other players who simply took the punches.\\n•\\tWarframe is a grind that can wear down players pretty quickly depending on what their goals are. If you happen to like the wrong weapon you may be in for some punishment while you pray to the RNG gods for the right key to get that last piece with a drop rate of 0.12%. Looking at recent additions, attitudes and past experience points towards this grind only getting worse in the future.\\n•\\tThe Dev’s for warframe (D.E.) are very fickle to put it politely. They’ll add something great only to muddy it up with ill thought out details or what feels like a rushed job. A recent example would be a new gun, the Hema, which is costing years’ worth of resources to build in an attempt to drain the player’s stock piles or force them to pump currency into the game to bypass this. \\nOn one hand stockpiles need to be drained so your players don’t chew through new content too quickly. On the other hand there are better ways of doing this than with a swift kick to the teeth. D.E. will leave the gun as is until sales drop, and then they’ll adjust the costs to avoid the community’s ire. This has happened numerous times and for some including me, these practices intentional or not are a turn off. \\nIf not for their excellent community manager Rebecca this game would not be where it is today with the way DE does things.\\n•\\tIf you’re a solo player you will put out more effort and time for less pay off than a group of four players who do less yet gain more, many times an event has happened and it’s been impossible for solo players to even attempt due to bad design (which is thankfully hotfixed in a day or two).  Warframe is made as a co-op game; it only allows you to solo as an option so keep this in mind if you have a bad internet connection.\\n•\\tWarframe is FILLED with forgotten mechanics and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ideas that were all left to rot. Heres a list within a list of some of these.\\n1.\\tClans\\n2.\\tArchwing\\n3.\\tCodex/Scanning\\n4.\\tSyndicates\\n5.\\tRelays\\n6.\\tThe focus system\\n7.\\tChanneling\\n8.\\tInvasions\\n9.\\tSolor Rails and solor rail conflicts\\n10.\\tOperators\\n11.\\tRaids\\n12.\\tRivens\\n13.\\tRathuum\\n14.\\tSoon to be: the infested room\\n•\\tWarframe has little to no balance to it. The newest guns will almost always be among the strongest to drive sales. This eventually phases out old favorites since they simply can’t function well enough in higher level content.  A majority of the weapons in warframe have ended up as garbage thanks to power creep\\nTLDR\\nIs warframe a good game?  Yes it is, you can see a lot of work and passion goes into it, unfortunately this is muddied by the devs themselves with their decisions and the way they handle things.\\nI actively warn people about warframe so I cannot “recommend” it. 2016 was a bad year for Warframe and the future dosen't look too promising either.\",\n",

       " 'So after playing Warframe for 1,040 hours (Steam says about 658 hours, but it\\'s incorrect.), I finally decided to write a review on the game. In this review, I\\'ll be stating how \"Free to Play\" the game actually is and what the gameplay is like, what the game offers in terms of content, and a pros/cons list at the end of the review to sum things up.\\n       \\nSo first off, how Free to Play is this game anyways? As a lot of us know, most Free to Play games have you paying for microtransactions to get most content in the game, with no way of using the in-game resources or currency to get them instead. Warframe does not do this, only cosmetic items, color pallets, interior decorations for your Liset, etc. Things like Weapons, Warframes, and Companions can all be earned by playing the game and getting enough resources/credits. Although Warframe and Weapons slots can\\'t be obtained without platinum (Warframe slots are 20 platinum each and weapon slots are 2 for 12 platinum), you can trade items in the trade channel to people in exchange for platinum. Another thing I should mention is Foundry build rushing. If you are building a weapon or Warframe in the foundry, you will notice a \"Rush build\" option. This isn\\'t spendy though, usually only costing 25-50 platinum to do so. Trust me, if you have what people want, you can obtain a hefty amount of platinum without paying a dime and have plenty to spend on rushing builds or buying slots.\\n       \\nNow if you actually start liking the game and want to spend money to get things quicker, this is where you could have a tough time. Market prices from Digital Extremes are, you could say, \"Extreme\". With Weapons usually costing about $5-$12 depending on the weapons and Warframes costing $5-$20 depending on the Warframe. To put this into a better perspective, it costs $5 for the most basic package of platinum, which is 75 platinum, all the way to $200 worth of platinum, which is 4300 platinum. There is a cheaper way to get platinum though. The game has a login reward system and sometimes you can get a coupon for 25%, 50%, and 75% off your next platinum purchase. This would be an ideal time to buy some. They started doing Prime Access, which allows you to access the lastest prime Warframe and weapons instantly.....for $150 of course. The cheapest package you can get in Prime Access give you just the prime accessories, a 90 day Affinity Booster, and a 90 day Credit Booster....for $50!! I feel Prime Access just isnt all that affordable, but maybe that\\'s just me. My rating on Warframe\\'s Free to Play factor is a 9/10.\\n         \\nAlright, next thing to talk about is the actual gameplay. Is it fun? Is it rewarding? Well, Warframe can be very fun to play at times, other times it can be annoying and tedious to play. It\\'s a 3rd person view Co-Op/PvP shooter with unique elements that will be talked about later. In the beginning, you will have a choice among 3 Warframes ( Excalibur, Mag, or Volt), you will have a choice between 2 primary weapons ( MK1-Braton or MK1-Paris), you will have a choice between 2 secondary weapons (Lato or MK1-Kunai), and you will have a choice between 2 melee weapons (Skana or MK1-Bo). Either of the Warframe are fun to play, in my opinion. The MK1-Braton is garbage, both secondaries are good for beginners, and both melee weapons are good for beginners as well. Getting used to some of the controls might be a pain at first (Such as wall-running and sliding), but eventualy you\\'ll get the hang of it and be flipping around like a space ninja in no time! Basically what I\\'m saying here is that the beginning of the game is hard to get past, in the sense that you feel underpowered and weak compared to your foes. If stick with it long enough to get better equipment, then it becomes much more fun to play. Weapons are fun and all, but I think the Warframes are what spice the game up the most. Each Warframe has a set of 4 powers that you unlock as you rank them up. The powers are some of the most fun this game has to offer. Example scenario: You are a rank 10 Excalibur surrounded by 25 Grineer troopers and there are just too many to shoot and kill before you die yourself. What do you do at this point? Activate Radial Javelin, which is your most powerful power as Excalibur, and watch as all 25 of them are pinned to the walls around you. Eventually, you\\'ll be able to do the same thing, but with 50 guys surrounding you. Warframe powers, yes please. Now what about rewarding gameplay? This game can reward you at times, however, it can be very grindy. The first thing you\\'ll probably farm for in this game are resources. Resources aren\\'t that painful to try to get, although Orokin Cells, Neurodes, Neural Sensors, and Argon Crystals are the ones you will be grinding out on the most. In terms of farming, the only real things that could be tedious to obtain are Warframe parts and Archwing parts. Speaking of Archwing, if you have played the game awhile now and feel the need for something new to do, try getting the Odonata Archwing and fly through deep space in Archwing missions. It\\'s a breath of fresh air if you feel like ground combat is getting boring. Gameplay can get pretty intense at times, if you finally have the loadout to survive 30 minutes on Warframe\\'s survival gamemode or 30+ waves on Warframe\\'s defense mode. All in all, the gameplay is fun, the farming/grinding isn\\'t always fun, but once you get that weapon built or Warframe built, the fun begins yet again. Overall, Warframe\\'s gameplay gets an 8/10 from me.\\n         \\nNow to talk about what Warframe has to offer in terms of content. Well, it has a lot of content to offer compared to when I started back in June 2013. There are 22 Warframes available to play as, not counting the Prime Warframes (Only difference is they have an extra polarity and look way cooler). There are  100+ weapons in the game as well, not to mention the primes of course. There are 14 planets to visit, each with increasing number of missions available. Tons of mods to choose from, including melee stances, which enhance your melee weapons by allowing you to perform combos. Just, plenty of content for a newcomer to explore.  Usually every two months, Digitial Extremes puts out a massive update, usually going up a whole number ( As in Update 14.5 goes to Update 15). These massive updates add hours upon hours of new things to do.

       " '\"Ninjas play free and slay gleefully\"\\nWarframe is the pet project of Digital Extreme, the canadian development team that has been behind the Unreal series, Bioshock and The Darkness 2 (along with Homefront which was still a good game overall despite its many flaws). A cooperative third person shooter with impressive visuals and art style, refined parkour and mobility options as well as an interesting take on sci-fi, it is one of the most active, successful and evolving game on the F2P market.\\nSet in the far future of the darkSector universe, the solar system is now in a constant war between the conquering Grineer and the merchant guilds of the Corpus while also brushing off the Infested, remnants of a bio-weapon from the past. In this age of conflict, An order of warriors who were thought to have disappeared come back at the request of an entity known only as the Lotus. The Tenno are awakened from their slumber anew, their powers only matched by their mastery of the Warframes\\nBeing a free to play title, this question will always come at the forefront of people\\'s mind. Put simply, let\\'s take in consideration what \"Pay to Win\" entails : the term signifies that a game allows paying customers to \\n than non-paying customers with no option for the non-paying customers to match this power equitably.\\nWarframe does not, in fact, allow paying customers to gain such power. In fact, most of the exclusively paying content of Warframe lies in cosmetics alternatives like skins, color sets, accessories and such. While you \\'can\\' purchase some weapons, Warframe and such with platinum (the paid currency in the game), these are also obtainable through seeking out the equipment\\'s blueprints and parts then crafting them into the desired items.\\nEven more so, many of the Prime equipment (more embellished version of the regular gear) cannot be bought outright except outside of a Prime Access offer which allows paying customers to gain a set of gear corresponding to the most recent Prime Warframe released. Even so, the difference lies that those who purchase a Prime Access do get a few cosmetics atop of the already obtainable Warframe and weapons through regular play.\\nMoreover, the Platinum currency is often used in ingame trading between players as the mean to buy Prime equipment part blueprints and other such tradeable ressources. Thus, the Warframe economy works on a supply and demand system where gaining rare parts and mods (more about this later) can be then be exchanged to other players in order to gain Platinum without personally spending money.\\nFirstly, Warframe is a constantly evolving game that has been nearly three years running. The game that it was in closed beta (where I got the first chance to play) has changed so very much that many that returns to the game today find it an almost completely different experience. From the game being now more approachable to having added many features that the community suggested to even revamping entire systems already in place for others that expand the gameplay greatly :\\nAs a free to play game, there is the required incentive for players to pay for things they could get for free by playing, aka a \"time wall\". For one, crafting of most weapons and Warframes isn\\'t instantaneous and usually can be counted in hours and, in case of an entire Warframe build, days (aka 12 hours per part, which can be done simultaneously, then a 3 day build for the final combination of the parts into a Warframe). Along these are some of the few points that might vary depending on the player\\'s opinion on them :\\nWarframe will appeal to those who wish to play a shooter with satisfying firearm and melee combat mechanics, flashy powers that are varied and unique to every Warframe. While the loot drops and slight grindiness can be a turn off, it is often offset by just how the gameplay feels fluid and intuitive to get into.',\n",

I started one last time after first 6  quests I started to enjoy and understand the mentality  of the game. I noticed that the fun part is not the level design or the game modes. What makes game different is each warframes abilities and types of weapons  and melees you can use. There bunch of combinations with every weapon, mod and warframe. Each one gives you different play styles and that keeps the game fresh and fun. Game doesnt teach you everything but community is really good and helpful.Any stranger from chat or in forums will help you.Also there is trading in exchange of plat(microtransaction).That means if you grind enough you can trade your items to but this currency.I bought plat for ones with %75 discount it was worth supporting developers.After each update they always kept bringing new content and story missions.Every new patch and quest means more story and more to do.You should give it a try but be sure you played \"The Second Dream\" and \"War Within\" those are the major and damn cool quests every gamer should experience these two quest.',\n",
       " \"This game is all sorts of amazing. I have played this game since around 4 years ago, taking 6 month breaks due to irl stuff and just being burnt out cause of how often i played this. \\nPros: \\nCompletely FTP - you can get pretty much everything in this game (besides some community made stuff - which are cosmetics only) just by playing the game. There is a currency you can get called plat which you can pay money for, but you can also get it just by trading people in the community prime pieces of equipment. You can get any weapon, frame, gear, pet, cosmetic just by playing the game.\\nTons of fun - I have over 1k hours in the game and i STILL am having a lot of fun with the movement system, all the different guns, all the different missions etc.\\nCommunity is amazing - For the most part the community is extremely helpful. I say for the most part because there are always trolls in free to play games, but i would say a good 60% (at least) of the people in this game have a relatively decent understanding of the game and know what they are doing and will try to help you out.\\nConsistent updates - Warframe comes out with a huge update, meaning new content, about once every 2 months or so. as well as a bunch of hotfixes (bugfixes) in between those times to try and fix the stuff they tend to mess up.\\nThe developers - The dev team behind this game is probably the most interactive dev team i have ever seen in any game i have played. they constantly are playing with the community, talking to them, and getting ideas from them. They occasionally upset the community with some things they do but if that happends, they tend to try and right what they did which i love. This game is completely community based and its beautiful to see it.\\nThe quests - This game's storytelling has gotten SO much better as time went on. all the new quests they have put out the past couple years have just gotten deeper and deeper with richer and richer storytelling. although some of them are fairly short the stories they tell are absolutely amazing.\\nCons:\\nVery rough on new players - Now grant it, this game has gotten a LOT better at helping new players adapt to the game, but there is much to be done. If you are a completely new player this game doesnt do a whole lot to help you. Now, on the same side of this the community which has played this for a long time (including me) understands this and tries to help out the newer players to try and help people. So if you arent used to fast paced gameplay, i would advise you to try and find some people to play this with to try and make it easier on yourself.\\nVery buggy - Even with all the hotfixes and stuff there are a LOT of bugs in this game. There is even a nickname for this game which is Bugframe. Sounds bad right? its not a huge con though, a lot of the bugs are pretty funny when they happen, very rarely are their any game breaking bugs that make it unplayable. It is mainly slight annoyances that with time will be fixed. \\nSummary:\\nThis game is absolutely AMAZING, it's progress has been amazing so far. It has gone from being a very bland space ninja, to an extravagant ever-growing beautiful space ninja. i can say without a doubt, if you are looking into this game you should definetly try it out. Everything the devs have done so far is absoutely amazing and it will continue on as time goes. \\nRating:\\nI would honestly rate this game a 9.9/10 - the reason for the missing .1 is because it is pretty rough on the newer players,  when that is fixed it will be a 10/10. DEFINETLY worth picking up.\",\n",

       " 'If you asked me before Scorched Earth was announced I would well you that ARK was the best game ever made. For until you got to mid-late game, on singleplayer or with a small group of friends.\\nWith this type of game attracts griefers, minecraft has em, Rust has em. I don\\'t like dealing with them so I don\\'t play on public servers, and I had fun. The game was in early alpha so the bugs were acceptable.... for the most part.\\nThis game has everything you\\'d want in a dino survival game, taming, breeding, hunting, PVP and PVE elements. But one thing they don\\'t tell you is how taxing it is to maintain any of it as farther along you go. In Singleplay I never had to worry about starvation or building decay as they only needed food when the \\'server\\' was up. On official servers you have to log on almost daily to make sure your dinos have enough food to last the next 24 hours, Plus there\\'s spoilage (Rather forgiving honestly) you have to worry about, that feeding trough you filled to the brim with meat? it\\'s full of almost useless rotten meat (you can make narcotic to tame even more dinosaurs!) in just one day. the feeding trough has a x2 preserving rate (meaning everything lasts twice as long) whereas the fridge makes them last x4 times longer, but you can\\'t use a fridge to feed your animals.\\nFarming is okay, keep a large plot full of poop (Thank you Phomia\\'s) and you\\'ll be rewarded with better taming goodies, or even dyes (Paints irl are made from flowers and fruits), or better yet concoctions that help you with one aspect or another. But you need the actual recipe to know how to make them. I\\'d give farming a pass as it (like everything else) is based on real time.\\nYou want to be like Jurassic Park and breed your dinos? do you like having no time to do literally anything else (this includes going to the bathroom and getting a snack) Babies go through food fast (understandable, they need enough to grow) but can die really quickly without supervision, and by quickly I mean you have seconds to feed your newborn hatchling. Here\\'s the kicker: Until they hit juvenile they can\\'t eat from the feeding trough, only hand fed. The Juvenile stage was added long after breeding became a mechanic, meaning you had to baby sit that trex you were hoping to raise until it\\'s an adult before you can get a break. the only saving grace is that they can eat from their inventories and as they grow they\\'re allowed to carry more and more until you can actually get a break in. If you leave them for a day they will die (like say, needing to sleep because it\\'s midnight and you are exhausted from caring for it all day)\\nArk had so much promise back then. And then Scorched earth was announced as the first DLC for ARK. my first thoughts were \\'isn\\'t ark an early access game?\\' and went to check, it was still an early access game at the time, it\\'s released now with all the bugs that should have been ironed out, more on that later. Developers seem to have misunderstood what \\'Early Access\\' means, Early Access means that the developer is allowing you (the player) to play thier unfinished game early. It\\'s a way of getting funding for the game as it\\'s being made rather than after it\\'s finished and then released. I wasn\\'t a fan of the Scorched Earth expansion, I never bought it no matter how cool it looked. but more for the message it told me: \"We\\'re more concerned about making money than finishing a game.\" Now I\\'m not ignorant to how games are made, I have a close freind who\\'s trying his hand at making games and on ocasion he\\'s told me the struggle. You need a pay check to give everyone, and ARK\\'s been in development for a long time so chances are they honestly needed the money to continue work on it. There are other ways to raise money that wouldn\\'t have made quite the ruckess, I\\'m not going to dwell on the past so I\\'ll leave it there.\\nAnd then Ragnarok became official \\'dlc\\', Wildcard has previously taken a fan made map and turned it into an official thing (The Center). But the problem is that this map has Scorched Earth accets on it, and it\\'s free. Meaning that I didn\\'t have to pay a dime extra to play with Scorched Earth content, the price tag for Scorched Earth now is just for the map. The glitch filled map.\\nI\\'ve never played on the Scorched Earth map, but they\\'re giving it the same care as they\\'ve given The Island. And ho boy are there issues with The Island. my Motto has always been to get a flier (usually an argy or peligornis) to safely get around, because if you took anything less than a Therizino you risked losing it to an Alpha. Alpha\\'s aide this motto has saved me a lot of stress as trying to navigate any terrain rougher than flat could lead to getting stuck, anything larger than a therizino can destroy trees, but nothing can save your rex if you get it lodged in free fall up against a cliff face. Or help you get back up to your dinos if you walk down a ramp only to find that you can\\'t walk right back up it. I\\'ve walked up a mountain on a Therizino (sheer face) simply because the mesh and hitbox weren\\'t the same, as some parts you actually dip into the mountain and can see beneath the map. This was there before Scorched Earth, I went to check again after release and it was still there.\\nI might not play multiplayer, but I keep tabs on the patch notes. The devs said that in the months leading up to the release they were going on a bug stomping spree instead of adding more content. There was only one patch and it added more dinos as well as getting rid of maybe one or two bugs.\\nWith a bit of reading aparently the clipping isn\\'t retrained to mountain climbing, you can have your dinos sniped from being outside of the map\\'s mesh. Speaking of mesh, if your rifle\\'s barrel is poking into the mountain (but your crosshair is clearly showing that you are aiming above the floor) you\\'ll shoot the mountain. This is a nitpick and most games have this issue, but newer players might want to know why they\\'re not hitting thier target even though it should be a headshot.\\nThese bugs are still here and now Wildcard\\'s announced the newest DLC to ARK, Abar-whatever. The problem is that they never stop adding content to optimize the game, ARK can lag hard at times (especially if it has to load lots of stuff) even when your graphics are on potatoe settings.\\nIf I didn\\'t know better I\\'d say that ARK was still in Early Access. if asked I\\'d tell you that I had fun with ARK. Nothings more fun than rampaging through the land on a Rex killer for the catharsis. I\\'m writting this because every so often I\\'ll check ARK\\'s news section and I see that Wildcard\\'s hinted at a sequel to ARK and I\\'ve never been more horrified. ARK is not a finished game, but it wears the skin of one.\\nGrinding resources to build anything isn\\'t fun, you mean to tell me that breaking this rock that\\'s five times my height only gives enough stone to make a flimsey wall? This game isn\\'t rewarding, the only fun is in the catharsis in sticking it to the mechanics that seek to keep you down. All of this is from a singleplayer perspective, but I\\'ve heard of what happens in the official servers:\\nAlpha tribes policing fun across every server. greifers able to vanish in the wind with the server transfer mechanic AFTER stealing all of your stuff. Tribes using the Server transfer mechanic to raid other servers when the tribes are offline for the day. This was offset by the fact that there were ways to block the obilisks and airdrops so that you couldn\\'t use the server transfer mechanic.\\nThe devs, as always. Instead of listening to the playerbase they rely on, made preventing this mechanic a banable offence instead of removing it. They\\'re allowing the greifers and the server wipers to go rampart. All of this combined is why I play singleplayer or with a few friends. In all honesty and love of this game, I cannot recommend it to ANYONE, but I will tell people about it and what it used to be.

For the most part in the game you will be grinding, basically 100%, with only small gaps in between the grinding, (You want to build a house, well first you need to level up about 15 times, chop down about 1000 trees and tare apart 50000 plants for fiber. Want to train a dino, well first go spend about an hour or more just collocting hundreds of berries if it a low level herbivore, and then sit around for about an hour well you wait to feed it more narcos.) If you ever do spend enough time in game to complete something substantial, you better beware, because basically everyone else on the island has spent just a little more time grinding then you and will kill you and destroy everything you own while your offline. The only way I have enjoyed playing this was with freinds, but you spend so much time finding each other, that normally one of you has to get off, and then you are all killed offline and have to start over again. There is very little skill in this game, 75% of the times i died in multi, was while I was offline, even the time where I had actually managed to build a multi walled structure with dinos protecting it. Maybe if the servers were more orginized into cities or vilages it would be funner, or if there was a better comunity. I am not asking for the game to be easier, I like hard games, I just don't have enough time to play a game were I have to grind for hours to achieve the slightest thing, then in the periods where I am actually dealing with real life, lose everything I spent my time on. The crafting system is also actremely generic, simplified to only a button click or 2. Unlocking new recipies is just a matter of grinding to level up.

All breeding for high stam birds was lost, severe waste of weeks if not months of time.  \\nGame devs don\\'t take criticism or suggestions (friends banned from ark forums and the like for politely written tickets regarding glitches and bugs).  They also ignore obvious problems with the game in favor of releasing new content.  Dinosaurs falling through the world floor has been a problem since day one and still hasn\\'t been addressed, for example.  You can spend hours taming or days breeding an animal and basically have it despawn on you.  Devs also don\\'t care about current player base.

       " 'Warframe is a fast paced RPG, Hack and Slash, and Third Person Shooter mix that blend concepts from popular games like Halo, Assassins Creed, and Call of Duty into one jam packed free-to-play online game. This game supports nearly every play style, and there is no one way to play. Unlike other games with four or five classes, this game includes 20 unique armors with unique skills to aid in your fight and with new ones added frequently. Also unlike most other free-to-play games it is not pay-to-win. Granted, you can only go so far in the game without the ‘special’ currency which you have to use to get extra ‘slots’ to store your armor and weapons, but that’s is one of the best parts of this game, you don’t have to spend a penny to get this currency, you can trade it with other players for things you’ve obtained in your missions that they need, you know how some people want to just buy their way to the end of the game, so there are always people buying and selling things to each other passing around this currency to each other. As far as the graphics go I am extremely impressed. The graphics surpass those of a lot of games that cost $40+ and still remain free-to-play. The gameplay is even more impressive, with 20 different ‘warframes’ to choose from and each having unique abilities, the game is very dynamic. The way I might use my favorite warframe might not work for you and you might be killed frequently while I blaze through killing everyone. Also there is a miniature card game involved and each warframe and every weapon has ‘slots’ where the cards go drastically changing the stats, survivability, and the abilities of your warframe and weapons. These ‘mods’ are sometimes dropped by your fallen enemies with different enemies having different mods they can drop. These mods can also be traded with other players for the special currency, other mods, or for blueprints for special items found only in a special kind of mission. Which brings me to another aspect of the game: crafting. As you progress through the levels you will pick up materials that you use to build new weapons, armors, and some very useful equipment.  Different locations have different components that drop from them. Being a game that takes place in space, each of the different locations is an entire planet, although most of the time your missions are inside the ships orbiting these planets. Each planet has most of its ‘nodes’ ruled by a single one of the factions, from time to time there will be missions where you support one of the factions to either invade and take over the node or defend it from the opposing faction. There are three distinct factions: The Corpus, The Grineer, and the infestation. The Grineer are the first faction you come into contact with, they rule the entire first planet and are the faction in the tutorial. They are a race of humans deteriorated from years of excessive cloning. They are heavily armored units with standard bullet shooting guns and feature everything from standard machine  guns  to flamethrowers and rocket launchers. The next faction is The Corpus. These troops are a mix between robots with mounted laser guns and cyborgs with different laser shooting guns. These units also have recharging shields like those seen in Halo. This factions weaponry is comprised of mostly repeating energy guns, again much like those in Halo, and continuous beam lasers, also like those in Halo. Another Faction is the Infested. These are troops from the Grineer and Corpus that have been afflicted with a parasitic growth that takes over and changes their bodies, a lot of Halo references here, these being completely identical to the flood in how they work. These units are almost all melee units that are very strong and attack in swarms. As far as weapons go they have their claws and the heavier unit will slap you with its stretching arm. Almost every planet has their own boss which will randomly drop one of the three pieces you craft to form you new set of armor. Each boss has its own set of skills which most of the time will have some correlation to the warframe obtained from killing them. For example the boss General Sargus Ruk uses a flamethrower and has a variety of fire based abilities he uses to try and burn you alive. Upon his defeat he will drop one of the three parts needed to craft Ember, a fire based warframe with two abilities nearly identical to those of Ruk. While on the subject of bosses, I am going to mention another of my favorite features. Upon killing a boss you have a chance to receive a ‘death mark’. Getting one of these will give you a chance to have a deadly assassin, appropriately named The Stalker; spawn randomly into literally any mission many levels above you with extremely overpowered weapons. He is thought to be a rogue Tenno, those who can use the warframe armors, and has the same weapon load outs and many abilities shared with other warframe armors. As far as weapon load outs go, you may carry around a primary, secondary, and melee weapon, and have the choice of only bringing one weapon with you if you would like to. With this comes even more diversity in play styles. Personally I prefer t use mostly just a melee weapon, relying on a powerful long range primary and short range secondary for those tricky kills. Others might use only there primary weapon completely ignoring their secondary and melee weapons. Each weapon can be outfitted with mods to drastically change how the weapon works, one mod can cause your weapon to fire two bullets at  time, while another may cause your weapons bullets to travel through enemies and objects such as walls or doors. Right now there are nearly 350 of these mods with new ones added all the time. There is also a large variety of mission types. Some of these include defending a certain object from the enemy, destroying targets such as the ships power core, or special machinery, to straight up kill everything on the ship.  This game also includes a very popular RPG tool: customization. On top of the mods you add into your weapons/armor, you can also customize the clor of your weapons and armor, and there are special attachments, bought with that special currency or obtained through one of the frequent events. As a paid game I would give this a 9/10, but being completely free-to-play it gets a 10/10. Definitely a game worth trying, and if you don’t like it you can just delete it with no worry about money you waited because its free',\n",

Gameplay wise, the game requires you good amount of grinding, if you are a RPG kind of player that is adapted to play repetitive missions this will not be an issue at all.\\nWarframe Developers are great, they release constant updates every month (sometimes even every week) and game support is the best i've seen. Devs are always in contact with the comunity and constantly reading player opinions.\\nA good point about Warframe is that it doesn't require real money to become strong, you can get almost all equipments without Platinum (real money currency) Anyways Platinum is a great help, mainly focused for players that lacks time to play.\",\n",

Was reporting bugs several times, even messaged devs about them, but not even a single reply, oh by the way, speaking about bugs, there are lots of bugs in game. Another very frustrating thing in this game is, that to rank up, you must pass the test where u have 3 tries and if u fail, u must wait 1 day and try next day. They made practice rooms, but it\\'s also aggravating, after failing, you are sent back to relay start and you need to walk again to enter in room.

       " 'Note - if you dislike the review, please feel free to leave why.\\nHaving put a good bit of time into it, I thought I\\'d finally \"review\" warframe. I\\'m not gonna do a stupid \"I jumped off a wall at a million miles an hour 9/10\" or \"Spun midair, became a rocket 11/10\" bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ Those aren\\'t reviews, and they aren\\'t useful.\\nSo, who am I? I\\'m a Hunter grade founder, roughly 1k hours (says 1.8k, WF in game says about 1k, I blame leaving it up while I sleep for the alerts :P), and I started playing in U7 so I\\'ve pretty much seen it all.\\nWF went from a game where they had cool ideas about what they wanted to do, to a bunch of half baked, never quite finished or polished ideas that eventually just seem abandoned. I.E. the revamp of damage/armour and weapons, Archwing, or Void Tower missions. Void missions were meant to be hard, and for the elite, and have amazing loot according to DESteve before they were implemented, but in reality they are very easy, and just another place to run a million missions hoping for the 1% drop chance for the item you want.\\nAs I see it now:\\nPros:\\n+Art team (sound, animation, graphics i.e.) is AMAZING (no sarcasm).\\n+Not P2W. Is it pay for convience, or pay to skip? Yes, to a fault imo, considering the prices are stupid. But everything can be earned in game, even if it takes a stupidly long time, and that time doesn\\'t corrospond to how good whatever the item you wanted is.\\n+Stamina/movement has been reworked. No longer do you run like a ninja. Who has asthma. And both their left lung just collapsed. And their right lung. And just had both their legs broken in a tragic zorencoptering incident.\\nCons:\\n-massive, MASSIVE grind and time walls (sometimes at the same time). Some grind is good, some waiting is ok. Done properly it enhances a game wonderfully, making that epic item so much sweeter and cool. WF however uses it in place of real content.\\n-P2P connection, no one likes lag, and WF rakes in cash. Servers should be a priority for WF.\\n-weapons are kinda meh. All the weapons of a given type feel the same (i.e. all bows feel the same, all snipers feel the same down to the RoF). By that, I mean they all just have slightly altered stats, none feel like they have recoil, or a worry about accuracy, or take more than point and click in the general direction. What I\\'m trying to say is that a lot of weapons (imo) just don\\'t FEEL like they should compared to a lot of other shooters.\\n-Plat is incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing expensive. I.e. weapon is around $10 roughly, and a new frame is roughly $20 iirc (assuming you don\\'t want to do the farming for them). To make it worse, there\\'s no rhyme or reason to their pricing. A garbage weapon might be more expensive than a better weapon for no reason, along with NO WAY to try before you buy ANYTHING. And contrary to what some people will say no, just because you like something does not automatically make it good, viable, or top tier.\\n-Enemies are stupid. The only difficulty there is for enemies is how many they throw at you, and how high their armor/HP/Shields and damage are. There\\'s no attempt here, not even say, to make the trash mobs stand by the heavy enemies who either give buffs, have bigger guns, and use special abilities (i.e. projecting a shield).\\n-Farming is either survival, interception, or defense missions. Everything else is either a ghost node (level/area) generally.\\n-Balance... doesn\\'t really exist outside of a general nebulous concept. This doesn\\'t sound like a problem, but balance is the lifeblood of any game. I\\'m not talking about one or two slightly OP weapons, I\\'m talking EVERYTHING is whacked. Clan tech weapons (very expensive to craft weapons) are mostly worse than what you can find in the markets for way cheaper (roughly 1/3 fewer mats in some cases). Worse, there are mods that have been around for a year roughly, and are just as useless as the day they were created, for example, \"Warm Coat\" is a mod that reduces shield reduction on missions that have the completely random ice effect, halving your shields. Besides the obvious flaw of not knowing when you\\'ll enter an ice mission, you\\'ll get better results from simply using a +shields mod of the same cost as Warm Coat.\\n-No endgame stuff. Sure there\\'s raids, but that\\'s just another place for them to add grind walls in place of real content. You\\'ll do some massive farming, but at the end of the day, it was all for naught unless you wanna run hour long survivals, or high wave interception/defenses. Once you get a weapon decently modded, any skill requirement goess out the window.\\n-Content is sparse, and often trapped behind massive grind or time walls to stretch it out. Problem with that is that it\\'s stretched nearly to the breaking point. Content comes down to grinding weapons/frames to level 30, forma\\'ing them (aka prestige) to make them slightly better, and repeat. Fusing mods to make them better and stronger, assuming you can FIND the ♥♥♥♥ing ones you want in the first place.\\n-New players have it extremely rough. They start off with garbage versions of mods, unknowingly, and the planets they unlock generally have the same mats, or atleast not enough different mats, which makes crafting anything very hard early on. Unless a new player has an older player helping them, they\\'re SOL. And the one thing that was supposed to help new players, the codex, doesn\\'t. You need to spend time unlocking it to learn enemy weaknesses, and what drops from them, making it even tougher for new players to learn about their enemies. Oh, and to scan the enemies? That costs credits for a consumable.\\n(INB4 \"But there\\'s a wiki!\" the info should be in game, easily accesible.)\\n-Lore, what they have is great, and really sets up a unique universe, the problem is that they don\\'t have almost ANY anywhere. Prime \\'frames in their codex entry have a tidbit, normally just an short few paragraphs, as do some of the other codex entries, and TSD which adds a good bit about the tenno. This isn\\'t so much of a con as they need more lore, which would be fantastic.\\n-Rushing\\nInherently nothing is wrong with rushing, but as a new player getting put with the more experienced players who just rush missions mean you\\'re getting left behind, and missing vauable loot (for a new player) as the mission ends early because people got to the extraction zone and started a 60 second timer to end the mission.\\n-Communication\\nThis is their biggest fault, their streams are a mess. DEsteve or DEScott usually being the cause. I feel sorry for DERebecca trying to control their lazy attitude towards the stream, treating it as a place to drink beer instead of answering question the community asks, and avoids/dodges questions with half answers or jackassery to (rarely) straight up insulting people (mild insults at best however) and flatout telling them they\\'re wrong despite everything saying they\\'re not (i.e. armor in D1.0 scalled up to a 95% reduction pretty quickly, and every weapon that did not ignore armor was pretty useless, DESteve was against reworking this, even though all but 4-5 weapons were considered useless).\\nAlso, going along with this, they\\'re NOTORIOUSLY poor at including all changes in the patch notes.\\n-Bugs! I expect some, hell, EVERYONE does. But DE either seems to do ZERO testing, or so little that people are unable to log onto the servers at all more than once. As in a 100% fail rate for everyone, not just a server overload or something. So, either they\\'re not doing enough in house testing, or they\\'re letting things get changed at the last moment before a patch rolls out.\\nConclusion:\\nI had high hopes for this game, and DE pretty much crushed them. If you like grinding korean MMO style, go for it. Otherwise stick with something better, like Evolve Stage 2 or, Overwatch. Or almost anything else.Overall, as the game is now, I cannot recommend it, as no matter how much things change, the more they stay the same.',\n",

       " 'Ok. I\\'ve put off writing a review for as long as possible in the vain hope that things would improve with this game. However, it is abundantly clear that the developers are - if anything - making a bigger and bigger mess of what started out as a great idea, that in spite of their lack of professional standards, customer support and communication skills,  Wildcards business unit (if they have one) have failed to force the \"creative\" side of Wildcard to take their fingers off the trigger and listen to some common sense and that - above all else - Wildcard really doesn\\'t listen to their customers, despite some virtue signalling from the companys appointed bubble-headed, blue haired moron to create an illusion to the contrary.\\n\"Early access\" be damned: these are people taking not insignificant amounts of money in PAYMENT for a product (AND for additional content!) that should - by definition of \"early access\" - be IMPROVING as time goes by, but it simply is not. The company has exposed its developers for the shoddy simpletons they really are. \\nThe only possible conclusion is that Wildcard are a somewhat fly by night group of amateurs, determined to \"take the money and run\", with little or no intention of sticking it out for the long haul.\\nAs an I.T. professional of 20+ years (most of which spent as a lead architect) and a small unofficial server owner with ~20-25 active players, I can honestly say that it is rare for me to experience first hand, a group of individuals profiting so much for such sub-par work. In any other industry, they would be fired; it is that simple. \\nOpinions are like a-holes: everyone has one, very few are worth listening to ;)\\nHowever the facts are incontrovertible:\\n1) Complete - and I mean, complete - lack of presence, support and interaction by wildcard devs, admins or even support workers on their OWN OFFICIAL SERVERS. Having played both official and unofficial (and now running my own) I can honestly say that Wildcards approach is a bad joke. Myself and my admins give a lot of support (usually in terms of workarounds for Wildcards stupidity, I might add) and we all work full time. Wildcard doesn\\'t even try. Take a look at their bug reporting mechanisms FFS. During my career, I\\'ve encountered small (less than 30 people) organisations that do far better with far fewer resources and much higher numbers of customers. As an organisation, Wildcard is appalling\\n2) Updates are Frequent, but almost always cause more issues than they solve, with most updates being aesthetic, superfluous nonsense. Updates ALWAYS result in the developers breaking more things - usually critical game mechanics - than they fix, resulting in server code that looks like the product of an incestuous relationship between Frankensteins monster and an evil goat to any professional worth a damn. The patch notes published by wildcards answer to Q & A in the guise of a blue haired buffoon, are also a joke with garbled or - more frequently no - explanations for the entries, spelling errors on items as important as server config commands (?!!), important items left out completely (presumably to facilitate them sneaking in unpopular changes, prefering their paying customers to find out changes for themselves...) \\n3) Game Mechanics are universally awful. This is - I am now convinced - the result of a severe lack of problem solving talent within Wildcard. Every time they encounter something - some way that the players are CHOOSING to play the game - that Wildcard perceives as problematic, rather than taking stock and looking at various SENSIBLE solutions, they almost always pick the simplest, most frustrating and game-breaking approach without considering the long term ramifications. This fact has been demonstrated over and over and has been a constant source of facepalming amongst those of us with any common sense; it really is like letting a monkey loose in the plantation.\\n4) The game is supposed to be - and was marketed as - a sandbox type, persistent world yet the developers are - more and more - steering the players towards a narrower and narrower gaming experience where building elaborate boats, playing solo and generally doing their own thing is being eroded. It was never their place to tell people how to spend their time and that they think otherwise suggests that someone in Wildcard has gotten a little big for their boots. When you fail to understand that ALL you have to do is provide a vehicle for people to have fun and instead start thinking that it is your place to persuade, cajole or hand hold players into playing a certain way, you\\'ve lost the plot.\\n5) Ark is so poorly optimised, even those of us with high end systems see quite abysmal performance, relatively speaking. To put this into context, to say that the hardware on which I run our unofficial server is overkill would be an understatement. However, the server still locks up / freezes on a frequent basis in the same way that official servers do. I see a fraction of the FPS that I see on other, more demanding AAA games. My workstation and server hardware & configuration have been analysed over and over. But in the end, examination of the server code reveals - and by wildcards own admission - that the game needs a lot of work.\\nHowever....a year on, we\\'re still seeing the same \"A bit further out...\" message in relation to optimisation. If you\\'re in any doubt whatsoever that it will ever happen, you\\'re right to think that way. After all, an organisation that puts the cart before the horse and thinks that making something look pretty should be a higher priority than making it POSSIBLE for people to play it properly in the first place may have dipped too far into the special educational needs inclusive recruitment barrel. Scraping even.\\n6) Abject failure by Wildcard to understand or even identify its player base, prefering instead to rely on some very misleading statistics. For example: quite a high percentage of players actually build elaborate boats (ships even) based off of the standard raft. Yet Wildcard saw that there was a high number of abandoned rafts on coastlines and elected to handle that by a) introducing a raft killer specifically to automatically handle the destruction of said rafts b) repeatedly \"accidentally\" crippling boat building by disabling players being able to extend rafts. This in a game where head mounted laser cannons (and even cannons) are touted as \"progress\" while in the real world we as a species had multihull boats for a millenia before the iron age! And yes, I know this is not supposed to be the real world, but it smacks of monumentally thick people at the helm when you feel raft building is an issue, fail to offer anything other than a wooden raft or a motorboat despite sea being more than 30% of the game map and mastery of it being essential for progression...\\nAnother example is the absolute failure by Wildcard to realise just how many of their players PREFER to play solo. Crippling those players through their engrams is - it has to be said - rather foolish.\\n7) I always felt bad for the poor Barstewards that play on console. Wildcard really doesn\\'t show them much love. It\\'s almost as if they are an afterthought, with patches occurring infrequently, late or not at all and with a number of features missing completely from their experience. I don\\'t play console myself but wildcards treatment of our console brothers is pretty appalling.\\nIf you are considering buying this game, my advice to you would be: don\\'t. It may be the case that Wildcard eventually pulls its collective head out of the horses behind, but in reality that is unlikely to happen. Whatever good idea this game was, has been swallowed up by repeated failures to listen to the customer, failures to establish even rudimentary support and infrastructure and a complete unwillingness to backtrack on its mistakes, fix them properly and learn from the experience. Such an organisation has no future, long term.',\n",

Yet at the same time, Ark: Survival Evolved never rose to the point of being a truly fun and engaging game.  Instead, it became a casual time-waster with ultimately no point.\\nThe game itself is gorgeous, and the worlds you can explore are beautifully crafted.  After encountering a game-breaking bug (more on that later) which ruined my initial Island game, and a bit of time in the Scorched Earth setting, I moved to The Center... and wow, that world is breathtaking.  Sure there are a few persistant graphical issues (purple rain, I\\'m looking at you), but nothing that seriously marred enjoying the scenery.\\nI really love crafting and building settlements and player homes.  That is one of the things I found most enjoyable in Fallout 4, and Ark: Survival Evolved gives a new and interesting playset to work with.  Most of my time in-game has been spent crafting, and I have some pretty homes and bases that I am rather pleased with to show for it.  Even if there really isn\\'t anyone to show them to.\\nWhich brings me to the core problem: \\nIf you play Ark: Survival Evolved, you are either going to play singleplayer, with a small group of friends on a dedicated server, or in the open multiplayer.  The last is, frankly, to be avoided at all costs.  The Ark MMO community is unimaginably toxic.  (And the game designers have actively promoted and encouraged toxicity.)  You can go to other reviews to get a full story.  That isn\\'t the point of this review.\\nThe survival elements of this game are very strong.  It takes a fair bit of effort to get to the point where you can sustain yourself.  But once you do, there is no plot.  There is no goal other than to build up to the next level of tech just to run around with different toys.  Mercifully, you can adjust settings to minimize the amount of grind, but even with those adjusted settings, the game is still at heart and MMO, and most of your time will be spent doing tedious chores rather than actually exploring or building.  \\n(And when you are alone, there is no one to really build for other than yourself.  At least in Fallout 4, I have NPC settlers to share my creations with.  In Ark: Survival Evolved, I finished building a grand room with a center table surrounded by chairs... and then stopped to look at all these chairs in a world where my character was the only human alive, and I thought, \"This is clearly a cry for help.\")\\nPlaying with a small group of friends on a dedicated server will allow you to avoid the toxicity of the MMO community and provide you with companionship that will drastically improve the fun of the game.  But eventually either you or they will succumb to the numbing realization that there isn\\'t a point to anything.  Without a plot, without missions, without goals or an end point, the game simply becomes stale.  And the lack of those things can be felt very early, giving the game a lack of depth and substance that is really required for an enjoyable RPG.\\nExploration on the beautiful maps like The Center can be quite visually enjoyable.  However, while there is a lot to see, there isn\\'t a lot to find.   Cool, new, unique places are abundant and I very much enjoy seeking them out.  But once you are there, they don\\'t offer anything.  Just a few resources to mine which, by that point, you have multiple other ways to acquire.  In a way, these places are like empty gift boxes with magnificant wrapping -- the sort you see in Christmas displays at the mall -- more enjoyable for the promise you can pretend they hold than their actual substance.\\nThe best part of Ark: Survival Evolved is the mods.  The modding community has built a lot of incredible content, and adding in mods breathes fresh (if sadly temporary) life into the game, as well as gives you a whole lot of new toys to play with.  I would have abandoned the game completely long ago, but with mods that gave me great new options for base building, or which allowed me to tame and ride a dragon, I kept finding reasons to come back to it and play a little bit more.  And those mods often lifted Ark within enough proximity of being actually fun to sustain my interest for a while longer.\\nPS: As the game is designed to be an MMO, there are some critical issues with playing it singleplayer or on a dedicated server which the developers refuse to address.  One such issue is that if you shut down the game or teleport away from an area before the resources respawn, they will never respawn again.  This is a game-breaking bug, and the best way to avoid it is to set the respawn rate as high as possible and be cautious in always making sure the last thing you harvested or mined has respawned before leaving an area or shutting down the game.',\n",

       " \"I watched this game (EA) release with caution – early access has almost become a synonym for ‘take your money and leave you with a rubbish product’ but after watching a lot of streams/gameplay footage and looking into the game I took a chance. This game has lived up to all of my hopes and far surpassed some – easily worth the money and STRONGLY recommended to anyone interested in the genre as a whole.\\nIt is unfortunate that this game has such a solid portion of negative reviews. A strong majority of the negative reviews are complaining that it is unoptimised (as to be expected in early access) and that when they play on low the game doesn’t look good compared to the trailers. I have a decent computer admittedly but I can run on ultra quite playable (scale back to high + to be smoother though) and it looks just as good as the trailer so the graphics are there, the optimisation is coming. The devs are incredibly active and the game is regularly patched in relation to not only preplanned elements but bugs and community suggestions.\\nFeel free to have a look at my screenshots if you want to see what it looks like at higher (but not full) settings. \\nThe main issues I have experienced is the dino pathing once tamed can be a little rough, especially once you start getting more and more dinos. On more than one occasion our little hunting party of 3-5 Dilos ends up missing one who is later found with its head in a rock somewhere. Far from game breaking but something to be worked on a bit.\\nThe control of tamed dinos can be a little clumsy (Using whistles to follow/stop works well but changing aggression requires you to go up face to face and cycle through a menu) and it would be great if you could assign groups - if a hunting party of 5 dinos is in the same area as someone else from your tribe with other followers, you manually have to tell each of them to stop - using the 'stop all' whistle will stop all the dinos in the tribe, not just the ones you have following. Note this is quite handy as it allows tribe wide dino control (which has come in VERY handy) but an additional grouping option with 'follow/stop my group' would make things much easier.\\nAn option to remotely set dino aggression stance would also be a godsend - In a tribe where we have 20-30 tamed dinos, changing all aggression stances is a task in itself.\\nAs far as gameplay, there is very little I could say against it. The game premise is great, content is through the roof. The levelling mechanic I feel works quite well and gives a small sense of purpose that you build your own experience around. It also allows you to customise your character to fulfil the role you wish to play.\\nIt is probably best to watch a few videos on taming and other core mechanics so you don’t waste your time as some things in this game do require a large commitment. Overall I think taming works well but do note that taming large dinos is a massive effort... A small Dilo may take 10-20 minutes to tame but once you start going bigger, it starts hurting. Larger herbivores (Trike, stego etc) take over an hour. Our T Rex took 3ish hours and our Bronto took a whopping 4.5 hours to tame (During which time you manage a two progress meters and defend from anyone/thing that comes by). While it is painful it does ensure that the apex animals are the prized possessions they should be.\\nContent wise... I have played a fair bit and haven’t even scratched the surface. We have a small tribe and have built up a bit of a base, tamed a Rex and a Bronto as well as a menagerie of other dinos but still haven’t cleared through more than one small island on the map. \\nOne thing that I am noticing now our base is expanding is the permanent impact you can have. When we first started our shack on the beach we were on the edge of a forest - Now the mountain is cleared and as we have built there it isn’t growing back. Very interesting sense of permanent change.\\nWhile we are comfortable in our little area, we still have yet to go into caves, the main mountains or deep underwater. I am currently sitting on 38 hours - The amount of time it would take to 'finish' all the content is staggering and more is coming. \\nWhile I normally stay right away from pure PVP (survival) games, this one makes it work. \\nThere are still a few of the sociopaths that seem to be everywhere online these days but overall it works quite well. I think the strong PVE backbone (ie. Dinos are bloody dangerous) tones the DayZ effect down a bit and makes for quite a good dynamic. There is still a deep distrust and caution applied when meeting other random people but it is far from a KOS-fest, indeed you will often find yourself cooperating while your interests align. (My tribe has been formed from me and one mate recruiting other stragglers)\\nPVE works great and levelling makes you far from indestructible (even low level Dilos can be an issue if your weapon is broken or you are taken by surprise without support). I have not seen the ‘endgame’ bosses (Super large creatures you summon with materials found on the largest and most dangerous animals on the Ark) but if you are into the MMO raiding style approach, that is there for you too.\\nThe beauty of this game though is you can make your own story - Having a tribe is great as it allows you to get larger scale things done (eg. building an expansive and well defended base) but I have equally enjoyed running around solo or with one other on hunting trips, operating out of small temporary outposts. The modding potential of this game is promised to be significant as the devs are giving access to their own editor for creation of mods \\nThis means that you can almost guarantee there will be a niche for everyone (have a look at Arma mods...) and will make the game playable (and even expanded) for many, many years to come. \\nEarly access is a bit of a minefield but over the space of the last few days with this game, I have had more enjoyment than I have with the vast majority of my other games and it has well and truly been worth the outlay.\\nHave a look at the trailer and a few vids - if your interest is piqued, it is worth the money.\",\n",

       " 'Ark Survival Evolved:\\nI have finally decided to review this game after 8400+ hours of gameplay in early access mode.\\nPositives:\\nThe game is a great idea. The way the game begins is tough… I mean really tough. It is a challenge to get started and anyone without any patience is going to struggle but I do have patience and to me the hard difficulty of this game was a real refreshing eye opener… but be warned it is not for the feint hearted. The best part of the game is the idea that you can breed your dinosaurs. This has been implemented in a really interesting way, where you can pool your breeding into achievable goals and breed out your favourite dinosaurs to have the stats that you have always wanted… but all this comes after you have set up a kibble base, and tamed great level versions of your favourite dinosaurs. I personally play on PVE and as you can see, for over 8K hours I have had a great deal of fun and I have met some fantastic friends in the community… This ought to be a great game, but there is another side to it that I have to address…\\nNegatives:\\nI am so sad to say this, because I have put so much effort into playing this game legitimately and have done my best to help create a wonderful community and support network on a great PVE server… however, the developers of the game have treated us long serving players with utter contempt. We have been completely mistreated, taken for granted, unrewarded, lied to, mis-sold to… under a cloak of awful communication and absolutely brutal and dire decisions that have kicked the games player base in the teeth. The scenario now is that the devs were going to cull the lowest 10% of ghost servers… and instead have decided to wipe over 33% of servers with medium traffic to consolidate their server lists and re-use these to plonk new servers on that do not have the same issues that the old servers had, and then to cap it all, any support for the old servers and the long serving players who play on those servers is to be canned so that we are on our own if we lose a character or experience any technical issues… This is a huge let down of the Ark gaming community, and sadly it is pretty irrelevant, because any support I have needed in my 8K+ hours has been utterly non-existent anyway. I reported a serious harassment case and followed every single instruction to the letter, and no action was taken against the wrong-doers. This was a shameful let down and completely spoiled my enjoyment of the game… The devs carried on doing little tiny favours for a select few gamers whilst most tickets were left completely unattended. I have colleagues who lost their level 100 character in transit and not a single effort to answer the ticket was made, that was over 2 months ago now. The sad truth is, that this team of developers and community managers, is sadly the most useless and incompetent and uncaring team that I have ever experienced in a game… so if you have any issues playing this game… do not even bother to report it… nothing will be done… this Dev team do not care. They care that they receive your money… they will go on to look after the new servers and make things look as though they are prepared to provide support there… but it is as many things are in ark… it is lies and false promises. \\nConclusion:\\nThis game had SO much going for it… it was a fantastic idea but the execution of the game and the choices made by the developers has left a bruised gaming community feeling ripped off and mistreated, un-respected and un-supported… and sadly their actions and incompetence in how they run their business has led to this review being a vote of no confidence. The way the legacy servers are setup now means that over-time the old servers will lose players and get wiped, so either old players stick around on current servers and wait for the server to die, or we start afresh on a new server and wait to be lied to and sit having no confidence that one day these new servers wont be wiped themselves… and that is the finding of this review… that ultimately, there is no point in playing this game, because it provides 10% fun, 80% grief and trolling and a final 10% of crying into your coffee as you hope your dino baby survives over the next ridiculously badly timed update that takes away something else that used to be a good idea. \\nDo not buy this game… do not play this game… go and play something similar where the developers actually deserve your money. \\nAddendum: After this review I was approached by a gaming website to do an interview looking into why I needed to play this game for so many hours. You can read that interview here:',\n",

       " \"Warframe is probably the best F2P game out there. It's not without it's flaws, certainly, but it's core game play is fun and engaging and fast paced and that's what really sets it apart. It's just fun to go and blast things. Even playing very similar missions many times over the moment to moment experience is always fun and frantic and that's why I've always kept coming back to it. \\nIt does have flaws. There's some grind to the game and while the variety of maps and missions has improved it's still not huge. Some equipment feel unique and interesting but some is pretty boring. For a new player getting the mods and equipment to really feel like you're making a contribution can feel like an uphill battle. But this is all mitigated a lot by just having fun running and gunning. \\nThere's always lots to do; guns and frames to build, resources to collect, loot to loot and bosses to kill. You're always progressing on something, just by running a few random missions. Unlike typical MMOs you can switch very easilly between styles of play and abilities so you can try things out and eventually will have access to just about every different style of play and ability if you want them. For much of the games content you can just pick what you enjoy and stick with it. \\nIt runs well on modest hardware; I'm running on an R7 360 and can get 1080/60fps with low/medium settings. If you have almost any modern graphics card then you'll be able to play this, even if you'll have to sacrifice the bells and whistles but it'll still look good. \\nThe business model is really very fair. There is almost nothing that you can't acquire simply through hard work and nothing at all that effects your in-game stats. The only really important thing that takes platinum (the purchasable currency) is storage slots for weapons and frames which are still technically optional although the longer you play the more you want to collect things instead of throwing them away. But this is offset by being able to trade loot items for platinum from other players. Being able to trade for platinum means that you really could play for absolutely nothing and you'd still be able to buy cosmetic items and slots. It's not easy, especially for a new player, but it's possible. You could never pay a penny and acquire every single piece of premium content. For a typical player you can spend $5 or $10 a couple of times a year and be comfortable and you'll never be punished for not doing so.\\nThe gameplay of being a space ninja is just fun. You move very quickly and can walljump and flip and run up walls to avoid enemies. You have space magic powers to hurl around. And you have the choice between rifles and shotguns to flamethrowers, rocket launchers, poinson gas throwers, black hole launchers and lightning guns. You feel like a badass splattering your way through enemies. Whether you are defending an objective, sabotaging enemy installations or breaking into enemy intelligence files but the core is always going to be obliterating swathes of enemies and feeling awesome. \\nAlso, you can get a space cat to attack enemies for you. \\nThe community is pretty good overall. Since you are all working on the same team much of the time there isn't the same kind of hostility you see elsewhere. There's still jerks (it's still the internet) but since you share goals and missions are short it's easier just to cooperate which makes for a better experience.\\nIt's a good game. It's the absolute best game that you can get as a F2P game. It's always engaging to dissolve a whole wave of enemies in a single attack.\",\n",

Now that’s partially because I’m a veteran and I’ve got not much left to farm for, but this is mostly because of the extreme grind it just forces you through if you want to get anything in this game.\\nThere are other issues, like enemies tending to be nothing more than bullet sponges and annoyances, and the trading/recruiting channels being nothing more than tedious walls of text, but all of them fall into the minor category compared to the grinding problem.\\nWeapons, Warframes, Prime Items, Special Items, Event Items; at least 80% of the game’s real content is locked behind Time walls, Wait walls, Pay walls and especially RNG- and Grind walls. Now I could totally understand this to some degree, but Warframe has crossed that degree \\n. With drop chances that rarely reach above 5%, and most missions being very lengthy and tedious, you have to grind so very much, it just becomes ridiculous.\\nThis is even worse for new players, who have to grind \\n FROM SCRATCH. Not only that, but there is so little in Warframe in terms of tutorials and information, that new players (and sometimes even veteran players) will often find themselves overwhelmed and confused.\\nNo, I’m very sorry DE, but I can no longer recommend Warframe in its current state. It wastes an unforgivable amount of a player's time on mind-numbing and monotonous grinding and it ruins the rest of the game. Something really has to change \\n in order for me to change my rating and start playing this wonderful game seriously again.\\nEDIT: Since I wrote this review, some things have changed, some things have not. The recent Plains of Eidelon update is one of the amazing things that has happened. To my disappointment however, not enough things have changed for me to go and recommend this game. The grind is still too ridiculous, and the other issues are still going strong as well. In fact, the Plains of Eidelon, as well as Focus 2.0, requires a ton of grinding to progress in it even slightly. So, I think my review is still pretty on-point in my eyes, and thus it's still a no from me unfortunately.\\n + Great Visuals,\\n + Great Sounds and Music,\\n + Great Gameplay,\\n + Supreme Customization,\\n + Free to play,\\n + Has one of the better communities out there,\\n + Good lore.\\n - Enemies tend to be nothing more than bullet sponges and/or annoyances. Bosses are never really interesting and a lot of the times have invulnerability phases and one-shot mechanics.\\n - Trade- and Recruiting channels are nothing but tedious walls of ever-moving text,\\n - Overpriced Market Items, Trading prices and Platinum prices. Platinum is priced so ridiculously high that the only sane moment you can buy it is when you recieve a 50% or higher discount coupon from login rewards,\\n - Developers seem to mostly forget about old content and balance issues - like for example Archwing - in favor of constantly pumping out new content,\\n - A lack of ingame tutorials and information, to the point where you'll find yourself almost exclusively relying on the Warframe Wiki and other external sources,\\n - Connectivity and lag issues can become a bit common,\\n - \",\n",

       " \"One of the most amazing concepts for a game I've ever played that has been completely destroyed by the devs. Before I start digging into the bad, which there's a ton of, I want to say what an amazing one of a kind design this game has. \\nI played PvE with my boyfriend and his brothers on a private server for about a week and it was such an amazing experience. After my boyfriend took a couple hours to set up the server we all started playing together, and it was wonderful. Starting out on the beach with nothing and just gradually working your way up was such a fun experience. At first we were constantly in danger, always having to watch our backs, but once we created our huts we finally found some safety. But there was always that element of danger when we played and it made the game exciting. Every time I ventured inland in search of resources or dinos I felt on edge. I would be terrified of losing the dinos I had or the gear I took and I loved every second of it. The first time I went to the center I couldn't leave my boat because I was so terrified of all of the caros and raptors I saw lurking around the beach. And the first time I lost my raft to a leed was amazing because it was just a reminder of the constant danger of the world.\\nBut all of that goes away once you advance high enough up the tech tree. Eventually you get to a point where you don't have to worry about any of the dinos you run into. By taming Argents you're able to fly all across the map without ever being challenged, and the large carry weight means you can just bring a couple and mine all the material you want and head back to your base. The challenge goes away. Guns one shot a ton of creatures and flak armor makes it so you can fight most wild dinos in a melee fight. My boyfriend was able to kill an alpha raptor on foot with a pike and flak armor by just running around it and hitting it in its blind spot. Eventually it just gets to the point where you're grinding and taming dinos for no real reason since flak armor and longnecks are all you basically need to become immortal in this game.\\nSo after about a week we got bored of PvE, but there was still so much to explore and do. So we decided to play PvP to try and get the challenge back. The only problem is that there is no challenge in PvP, it's impossible to play and you'll just frustrate yourself if you try. Basically every server has a massive alpha tribe who owns a server, and they go on wipes to make sure that no one else rises up and challenges them. Imagine spending an entire day scouting out a hidden base location and grinding out resources in order to build it and than just having some hacker come along and esp it in the bushes. Hackers aside, the way the game is set up is designed to keep alphas on top and new players on the bottom. All the new stuff that is being added doesn't benefit new players because alpha tribes will never let you obtain them. They block off caves and put auto turrets there so that no one can go down there and get good gear, they place metal foundations in areas that have easy access to metal and crystal so that they don't respawn and other players can't use them. And even if you are somehow able to build a base, it's impossible for you to protect it. I had built a huge fortress with a ton of tames in it that me and my small tribe got that day. When we all logged of that night the alphas on the server  came and destroyed it all. By using the website Battlemetrics, they're able to get alerts sent to their phones when a specific player logs off or onto the server, meaning that they always know if you're online or offline. And because of this they will never attack you when you're online because it makes it a little bit harder for them (even though all their dinos and gear are 3x better than anything a new player can get). And the game is designed so that literally anyone with enough explosives and time can destroy your base (unless you're an alpha in which case you have an indestructible fortress with hundreds of auto turrets and thousands of plant x). There's no defense against this which means you're always vulnerable, even if you have a metal base with a ton of guard dinos.\\nThe devs just seem content to let their game die, every update they put out makes the game a little bit worse. Server transfers were the start of this game dying off. Anyone can transfer onto any server and bring any items they want, which means that alpha tribes can just raid on another server and than leave. Processes like breeding are impossible for a single player to do, if you don't log on for one day during the two week process than your breed dies. If you're not constantly watching over it and making sure it's feed, it will die. This means if you're a normal person and have work or school, than this is something that isn't possible for you to do. Large tribes have giant breeding rooms full of air conditioners and tribe members to feed them so this isn't a problem for them. And the biggest issue with this is that breed dinos can reach a much higher level than wild tames. So anytime you face up against an alpha tribes dinos its always going to be better. And now the devs have added a tek cloning chamber, which is also impossible for small tribes to get because the only way to beat bosses in this game is to tame multiple high level rexes and attack it at the same time. It takes 0 skill to do, all it takes is someone who has a ton of tribe members who do whatever he says. So people saying you need to get better at PvP haven't realized that it takes literally 0 skill to be an alpha. All it takes it tribe members and resources and you can overthrow anyone if you have the time.\\nMy last point is that the game literally punishes you for not playing 24/7. Dinos have to be fed often or they'll die. I had a high level argent that I tamed and it died the next day because I forgot to put food in it's inventory.  That wouldn't be a huge issue but food spoils, so if you go on vacation for a week and you're not playing ark the whole time then all of your tames will die. And if you're not online around the clock than someone will come along and destroy your base. And not to mention all the grinding this game makes you do. This game might as well be called Farming Simulator 2017 because that's what you spend the majority of your time doing. And than when you log off that night someone comes along and steals everything you farmed. If you want to try and go raiding you have to spend the whole day farming materials and at the end of the day you get 40 C4. Meanwhile alpha tribes can get hundreds of C4 within an hour due to all their members, tames, and the exploits they use. \\nAnyways I'm done with this review. It's sad to see such an amazing and unique idea turned into such a♥♥♥♥♥♥show. To sum it up PvE is cool at first but gets really boring quickly and PvP is a broken mess that you shouldn't even think about trying to participate in.\",\n",

       " \"I think I'll kick this off by squashing a few rumors or misconceptions, Warframe is NOT a Pay2Win game but it is in a Pay for Convenience format. What do I mean by Pay for Convenience? Every gameplay changing weapon, item, part.etc can be gotten through simply playing the game whether you're grinding for that specific resource or rare drop or not. Another feature is these 12/24/72 hour building periods for weapons, enhancements or Warframes. BUT HOW IS THAT JUSTIFIED?!? Well that's simple, this is a Free to play game and the Devs need a way to earn money, yet you can still get every item you want simply by playing and waiting. If you choose to spend money you can use it to rush foundry builds or outright buy items from the market or trade chat. Another thing to note is this game is still technically in beta (despite having a working ingame Market focused around premium currency) and receiving updates nearly every week.\\nNow that that is out of the way lets move on to the real review.\\nWarframe is a game about an ancient warrior race, they are called Tenno. (some may recognize this as the last name of the protagonist in the Dark Sector series, that game is also created by Digital Extremes an Warframe is seen as its successor) In a nutshell they are a group of Space Ninja whose sole purpose is to maintain balance of power in the Solar System. How might they do that? Simple, they slaughter hundreds of deteriorating clones, Greedy Merchants and Infected who are pretty much zombies of the aforementioned clones and merchants.\\nGameplay can be a mixed bag for people, Its generally Pve with the occasional pvp thrown in due to fan requests. You will have a Primary, Secondary and Melee weapon. This is simply to create versatility in your loadouts and to offer unique ways to approach the fast paced combat. Now I mentioned before grinding and waiting times, yes you will need to wait a few hours or days to build your new weapons and Warframes but its Free to Play so I'm going to let it slide.\\nI understand this review could be more concise, but there are so many more that do this game more justice than mine. Besides its free to play, you should give it a few hours and then decide for yourself.\",\n",

There are a bunch of planets available to you, each with sectors ( missions ) with different gamemods which you complete for rewards. The game uses tiles to randomly generate levels. Some planets have unique tilesets, etc. Has a bunch of different weapons and weapon types, each item has to be ranked up with XP. You can then mod your weapon/warframe/etc with a huge amount of mods to tweak each parameter to your liking. Has a lore, but there's no campaign as such, just a few story quests.\\nREAL MONEY\\nBasically almost nothing is locked behind a paywall in this game. The only exceptions I found are some cosmetics ( character attachements, color pallettes, animations sets ) and inventory size ( For weapon and characters ).\\nYou can trade in-game currency bought for real money to other players at higher levels, which means that you can unlock pretty much everything for free, which enough time put into the game.\\nNot only that, but you can get a -75% discount on Platinum ( Currency bought for real money ) as a daily login reward, and for 5$ you can get enough of it to lift all restrictions on the inventory size and buy some cheap cosmetics. Buying weapons/characters for platinum is pointless because you can simply craft, or acquire them otherwise.\\nSCORE\\nIf I had to give it a score, I'd say 7.5/10.\",\n",

I cannot begin to describe how happy I am with the growth of this game, it blows me away every time an update rolls out. The events are super fun, the weapons modding is full of tons and tons of options, there is an ever growing list of items and warframes... there is just so much to bite into in this game. I am a person who enjoys deep detail and stats and customization, and this game speaks to that need very well, in addition to its utter crafted beauty.\\nOh, by the way, it's totally free.\\nThe only place I find a little lacking is lore. They have done a lot of worldbuilding and set up a great stage for their characters but have not embellished them or the history of the world very much. This grows with every update, of course, but I feel it is growing much more slowly than the game itself is. I'd love to even just be able to read more somewhere, if nothing else.

You fight with swords and axes and guns and all kinds of weaponry.  Each Tenno, of Warframe, has a different set of powers to master.  Some Warframes may not fit your playstyle, but there are plenty to choose from; I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, there are currently TWENTY-FIVE DIFFERENT \\'FRAMES to choose from, and the dev\\'s add more on a regular basis.

Yes, microtransactions exist, but they take a backseat to the gaming experience.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, is available to non-paying players -- as long as they\\'re willing to grind.  Microtransactions consist of purchasing fully-built Warframes, Warframe cosmetics, or fully-built weaponry.  No advantage is obtained if you buy a weapon rather than construct it; it\\'s the exact same thing.

I feel tthat the developer has lost heart and now want to cash in on what they have in hopes that they can move on to something new.  So what state does that leave the game in... well pretty much a mess at this point.  Sure the developers are scrambeling to patch up game to try and fix a few things, but they hope that if they just slap a new UI on the game that they hope players won't notice the flaws.   \\nSo let's have a basic rundown of what we have\\nSo if you can handle paying the $60 price tag for a game that I don't think will ever be in a properly optimized release state and can handle the other issues I've mentioned then ARK is an all right game with great looking graphics and the potential for some great online fun under the right environment.  but if you can't handle these issues, then I would recomend staying away from the game.  \\n=== Original Revier ===\\nFirst of all I played this game back when they had the free weekend, and at that time I was on the fence with buying the game.  Yes the visuals are great and the concept has a lot of promise.  And I might also add that during the free weekend they were working their butts off to get patches out to fix problems that cropped up with new content that had been released.  \\nNow Fast forward to the time of the review and what do we have.  Well first of all, I still haven't purcahsed the game, and with the recent release of paid DLC before the games release with the notion that it's for testing purpose leaves a really bad taste in my mouth.  if they wanted to test the content and the underlying server tech behind it, then they should have released it free, and then set the price on the games release.  Also add in the fact that the DLC adds in unfair advantages that can be taken between the paid DLC and the base game, what does this mean for people who don't have the DLC, you're at the mercy of players who do.  And with ARK being a highly competitiv game there will be those who will set out to runin the experience for others.  \\nAs for the game itself.  If you're looking for a simple player experience there is one there, but if you actually want to finish the game that could be extremely tricky, if not impossible.  The game has designed in such a way that it's not something that can be done by one person.  you WILL have to go online and play on the ARK servers to complete the game or even get access to the DLC that you've purchased.  \\nWhen it's all said and done, I can't recomend a game that gives players a distinct advantage over others just because they paid money.  Games are supposed to be fun and entertaining.  I just hope that the developer sees the errors in their ways and at least adds in the ability to prevent content coming in from the DLC to keep non DLC Enabled servers fair to others.\",\n",

Dev's of all games work hard to balance their games to make fair for everyone to play.  But by allowing someone to harvest materiels, build all the guns and ammo, and breed high level dino's then transfer all that to another server where a society and pecking order has been establish by many hours of hard work and conflict.  The players that are doing this are able to completly destroy a server in a couple hours, then transfer back to where they came from.  You then log on to find that thousand of hours of work has been destroyed by someone.

ARK is the first early access game that I’ve personally played that doesn’t feel like early access. It’s got a lot more content than most finished games. The developers are usually always coming up with new content to keep the game fresh and the base game is fantastic while only getting better (most of the time anyway). There’s a few big issues with the current state of the game, but I’m willing to give the devs the benefit of the doubt that they will try to balance it out before launch.\\nPros:\\n-Hundreds of hours play time either by yourself or with a friend. For $29.99 this game has lasted me much longer than almost every full priced $60.00 game I’ve purchased in the past 10 years.\\n-Many different dinosaur species to tame and more on the way\\n-Beautiful world that has great map design. Everything feels hand crafted.\\n-Building a base feels more like building a home rather than a hole to hide in until PVP\\n-Dinosaurs control well and you’ll really develop strong bonds with your tames (including incredible sadness if they die)\\n-Graphics are beautiful (if you can run them) and help immerse you into the well-designed world\\n-Forming a tribe can lead to fantastic friendships\\n-PVP is incredibly tense and when played well you can get into seriously intense action\\n-Very rewarding but difficult learning curve\\nCons:\\n-At times the game can feel like a chore. Lots of grinding and some taming can take more than 3 hours\\n-Very unbalanced PVP that can really turn most people off\\n-Kibble that can shorten tames are being implemented poorly (EG late game dinosaur eggs required for mid-early game dinosaurs)\\n-Giganotosaurus completely broken (turned off in my private server)\\n-Needs better optimization\\nAll in all ARK is a fantastic game. If you’re even mildly curious about it give it a shot. It’s been a game that has consumed all of my time and I love every minute of it.\\nI highly suggest staying away from official servers and try to find a nice unofficial one. They usually have better tame times and active admins can remove problem players fast.\\n ',\n",

       " 'I loved the game to death when I got a PC that could actually run the unoptimized as F*CK game at atleast 40-50 at high/ultra. I found a friend and we actually got a base going. I woke up on a beach to find him harvesting thatch. I turned on my mic and he asked if we wanted to team up and build a base, so I agreed because I  could barley get to wood tier on my own. We actually made a small wooden base on a beach going out and mashing our E button to harvest rocks. We got a relitivaly large stone tier base. We would take our dinos to go metal harvesting. A few days later we were taming a beaver so we could mass harvest wood. Then the most iconic situation corelating to the game happened. As you probably already guessed we got raided... It was a memer/troll tribe going out to destroy tiny bases and just f*cking with people trying to play the game. It started in a normal day, I was helping tame the beaver dino and then a tribe came to our base. They told us the get the F*ck out of \"Their\" beach. We said that we grinded all week but they kept telling us to get out. Then the just randomly shot our beaver and insta-gibbed it. They shot us and then got out a rpg and shot mutliple missles at our base that took a week to make. After that we rebuilded out of that area. We made another base in the mountains with cats being a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥we moved again. We had a great base with some good mid tier weapons and resources. Then we logged of for the night.... You can probably guess what happened next. We woke up on a raft in the middle of the ocean with poop in our inventory. \\nI love the game but its so annoying to grind and log off and get f*cked with. God forbid you don\\'t play Ark 24/7. Fun game despite some bugs and annoying♥♥♥♥♥dinos but sh*t/toxic community.',\n",

       " \"It's so sad watching my favorite game of all time being ruined by its own dev team. Instead of letting players to have more freedom in advancing to higher lvl, DE pumps out nerfs after nerfs, removing game components, and the only thing they keep on adding are countless of useless items with slightly different stat from eachother, so people think they have a choice. DE used to be nice and friendly but then became so greedy and distant, while all these new players keep pouring in and buying platinums, DE isn't ever going to change. I can't even try to make a point anymore, any discussion criticize the game on the forum alway get bomboarded with negative and toxic responses then get flagged. I tried not to hate it, I tried to keep on playing, but one by one everybody in my shadow clan quit, saying it's just not fun anymore so now it's just me here, all alone. I doubt this review would make any impact at all, just 1 less player in hundred of thousand. Nevertheless, thank you for 700+ hours of fun, good bye warframe.\\n-------------> EDIT (5 months after): \\n I see so many people defending this game, give positive review and down voting negative reviews, saying this game is the best game ever and those negative reviews arent reflecting the game. \\n There seem to be a misunderstanding between new and old players, yes this game is indeed a VERY GOOD GAME, my personal favorite game still; BUTT, it used to be a lot better. I love this game so much but the dev already milking it for money. Warframe finally got a decent regcognition from a lot of people, but then the dev team made a u-turn and made a lot of players unhappy. \\nOriginally there were several well known problem especially with the games difficulty that was brought up over and over again and the community's suggestion for that was more end game content so we have more to do than just grind. Then came archwings raid, daily missions, and second dream update, it was the best time i had in this game, and i was pretty sure this game is going to blow up in popularity. Sadly the fun stopped there, it started with the warframes rework, most people were ok with the changes they made to volts and mag, then came the controversal patch where they reworked a bunch of other warframe all at once without little announcement and zero testing, some change were good, some were bad, the change was supposedly balance all warframes out so none would over shadow other, in reallity it's just a bunch of nerfs that made the op warframe unexploitable, and also made the already bad warframe obsolete. instead of fixing their problem, DE decided to keep going scrapped the void, changed the navigation (it is so complicated and confusing, far too unesscesary compared to the old one), and completely destroyed the dream.\",\n",

I love it. Interacting with dinosaurs? Amazing. Building a base? Amazing. The overall concept of the game? Amazing. \\nThe difficulty? There are so many times in this game where something stupid happens and it literally has a domino effect on everything else. It\\'s immersive. You take ONE moment for granted while you\\'re mining, or picking some berries and out of NO WHERE you\\'ll get bum rushed by a large dinosaur who\\'s hungry and wants YOU and your TAMED animal for dinner. Within moments the flying mount you\\'ve spent HOURS taming can be gone. It\\'s infuriating. You get so mad, and then you go back, and you rebuild. You go find another dinosaur to tame. YOU won\\'t get beat by the game. Even at higher levels it\\'s difficult. It\\'s unforgiving, and for that I appreciate the game itself.\\nWhy can\\'t I recommend this game? It\\'s broken. I\\'ve been playing since Alpha and there are STILL snapping issues with buildings. You have structures that have clipping issues and make it difficult building things next to each other. You know minor things that can be fixed relatively easily that have just been overlooked.\\nSome of the dinosaurs are incredibly unbalanced. MicroRaptors are hands down the worst thing ever introduced to this game. You literally have no way to combat them and they often come out of no where and are found near numerous other dinosaurs that have no issue taking a nibble out of you and your mount while you\\'re stun locked for 10 seconds. It\\'s hard enough being knocked off of your mount. This is just one of the examples I can give as far as how over powered some of the dinosaurs abilities are.\\nConstant bugs. This game had NO business exiting early access. I can honestly say that. Every single time you roll out a patch you\\'re breaking something within the game. It doesn\\'t necessarily have to be a large patch like the recent one with aberration. Often times it\\'s small little patches that cripple the game system to the point where it\\'s unplayable. I recall a patch not long ago where anytime you went to harvest stone the game would just hard crash each and ever single time. \\nStuff like this shouldn\\'t be happening to a game that\\'s out of Early Access. \\nQuite simply. This game was not ready for a full release. It still is not ready for a full release. You shouldn\\'t have game breaking bugs every single time you release a patch. A proper game that is ready for release is Polished. It functions. This game does not fit either of those criteria. It\\'s understandable to have SOME issues with each major patch, and we appreciate how often Wildcard releases patches and adds things to this game, but this game is still by all means an Early Access title. \\nFor that reason, and that reason alone. I cannot recommend that others buy this game. Not until Wildcard fixes some of the glaring stability issues that it has.',\n",
       " \"There is no clear objective in Warframe. Warframe is a game where you have to set your own, small goals, to keep you playing. They are consistently adding quests into the game to give it a bit more of a back bone, but besides that, you mainly keep playing through similar missions over and over again, killing similar enemies, in order to level up your Warframe and weapons so that you can eventually kill the same enemies faster or kill them in more interesting ways. With that being the case, Warframe is a grindy game and in order for you to enjoy it, you must enjoy the base feel of the game. If simply killing enemies isn't satisfying for you, then you will likely get quite burnt out on the game.\\nThat being said, Warframe has a ridiculous amount of content such as Warframes (kind of like classes, they have different abilities), weapons, and mods for both your Warframes and weapons, so you are sure to find at least one Warframe and/or weapon that you find very enjoyable to play. For me, I just like to theorycraft and try out different combinations of weapons, warframes, mods, etc. to create new styles of play that can not only be fun, but also very effective.\\nWhen you first start out, there is definitely quite a steep grind you have to get through and the starting weapons/Warframes are not all that exciting, but the more you play the game, the easier it becomes to unlock new gear and once you have at least some gear that is high level, it becomes easier to level up new weapons and Warfames you craft.\\nIn the end, I highly recommend trying out the game for a couple of hours and see if you enjoy the feel of the game, actually shooting enemies, using your Warframe abilities, or just cutting them up with melee weapons.\\nAfter 1200 hours (plus the number of hours I played before the game was on Steam), I will admit I am burnt out, I know the missions and enemies by heart, not much comes as a surprise, but I always come back to play when they release new content because this game is great for theorycrafting and adding all types of ingredients into a stew and seeing what the outcome is, and lucky for me, they are always adding new ingredients.\\nAlso, their cash shop system is very fair for a F2P game.

       " ' \\n  Studio Wildcard\\n: Studio Wildcard ,Instinct Games ,Efecto Studios ,Virtual Basement \\n:  Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Early Access\\n 2 June, 2015\\n 100+\\nLet’s start this review off with the most talked about issue surrounding the game: its performance. While there is a very comprehensive menu with lots of settings you’d never have thought to create in regards to the visual settings, even with a blend of medium to low settings I seem to max out on 15 frames per second with a few random glitches. While it is playable and no where near as bad as it was when it first came out, it isn’t ideal. If your system can somehow run the higher settings, then the game is incredibly beautiful and you’re going to want to take hundreds of screenshots.\\nBefore you start to play, you’ll have the option of creating your survivalist. You are presented with sliders for head, torso, leg, foot and arm widths, lengths and heights. You can change the colour of your survivalist’s hair and eyes, though you can’t really see your eyes anyway and the hair colours are kind of dull. You unfortunately only have one hairstyle, and I’m hoping that once the game leaves Early Access it will have several options to choose from. Honestly, the best part about the sliders overall is that you can have different character heights from all the other players around you, something that not even The Sims 4 has managed to accomplish.\\nAs you wake up in the world of Ark, you notice the many HUD indicators for survival purposes. Some of these include stamina, food, water, health, oxygen and your level progress. Watching and being aware of these is the most important thing that you can do in this game. If you have too low stamina, you won’t be able to run away from the raptor that is chasing you. If you have too low water or food, your screen will start to become clouded with the same red effect we’re all used too in survival games.\\nThese indicators can also be affected by the weather. Severe heat can damage your health, and running through a humid rainforest will take a higher toll on your stamina and hydration levels. A handy feature is being able to drink rain straight from the sky for when you’ve died and lost your waterskin or are too far away from a river, pond or the ocean.\\nCrafting is a huge component in Ark. If you’re familiar with Rust, the crafting system in Ark is somewhat similar. As you level up, you gain engrams that can be used to unlock blueprints. Blueprints ten levels ahead of you will be hidden, encouraging you to continue to level up to find out what they are. This system also encourages a lot of planning, forward thinking and just plain luck, as you can’t unlock all of the engrams at the same time.\\nLast but not least, the one major feature that distinguishes Ark from the many other survival games out on the market; the dinosaurs. Able to be tamed and ridden, a source of food and a way to make the resource gathering faster, they are a vital component of the game. As you learn which dinosaurs are dangerous and which are not, you gain confidence with your ability to survive in the land of Ark. Taming dinosaurs is an adrenaline-filled process that requires a lot of teamwork, but the payoff is worth it when you put a saddle on your first T-Rex and stomp off into the sunset. In a major case of art imitating life I accidentally seemed to have exterminated the entire dodo population at one point during my playtime as they were the only non-dangerous sources of meat in the game. Thankfully, it doesn’t take too long for dinosaurs to respawn and when they do they tend to respawn in the same places. This can either make your game raptor-filled hell if you accidentally build your base too close to their spawn points on the island, or very easy, if you build your base on one of the southern islands that no carnivores inhabit. \\nWhile the performance of this game is lacking and a few key survival concepts of the game haven’t been re-imaged from the other survival games out there, Ark: Survival Evolved is a very fun game that will fulfill your childhood dreams of having a pet Tyrannosaurus Rex, even if you lose everything and your tribe in the process.',\n",
       " \"Warframe is one of the best game I've ever played in my life. This game has so much potential that you can literally ask for anything from the developers and they'll do it if a lot of other players also asks for the same thing. I changed my review of Warframe several times because of this fact. I first started playing Warframe on late 2014 and I loved it. But then, I felt that the gameplay was way too-repetitive and easy and I eventually got seriously bored of it. I even almost fell asleep while leveling up my weapons back then. I started playing again on mid 2016 since I saw a lot of update notifications passed by and it just blew my mind. The amount of changes they made in the course of ~1.5 years is amazing and I currently have played way more hours than back in 2014. Unlike my old review, I'm still not bored of the game at all and it's definitely has not become a 'lullaby'.\\nNew player? Read the 'Common misconception' part below first.\\nWarframe's main advantage is its extremely active and communicative developers. They listen to their 26 million registered users (trying to point out it's extremely popular - I know not all of them are active or giving feedbacks) across platforms really well and they change A LOT of stuff quickly. They changed the parkour system completely, they added tons of new weapons and warframes, they added new landing crafts, they expanded the landing craft interior, they added new well-written quests that adds a lot of story element into the game, they added cute puppies and kittens, they even added space battles and underwater battles where you'll fly/swim around with an 'Archwing'. Feeling like there's no endgame content? They added the 'Focus' and Arcane systems to further upgrade your warframe and made it possible for you to beat enemies four times stronger than your maximum level. Want to see the dev's progress? They have the devstream and Prime Time stream on Twitch every week to give you the latest update on what they're doing and they'll tell you the upcoming update so you can hold onto their promises. This is the reason I said that Warframe has a huge potential.\\nNow, the most important element: gameplay. Warframe's gameplay is no longer boring or limited like back in 2014. Bored of defense/Mobile defense/Interception missions to level up your stuff? Now there's an excavation mission. Feeling like going sneaky-beaky like? Play your Mission Impossible theme while parkour-ing across lasers and avoiding cameras on Spy missions. Feeling like bored of every mission? Fly into space or jump into the ocean to get an entirely different combat system with your Archwing. Feeling like it's too easy? Go for the intense Sortie missions, Raid missions, or Nightmare missions. Gameplay varies a lot and the devs will add more in the future. They even said it's possible to make the game an open-world RPG one day.\\nBut is it all perfect? Of course not. With these massive changes, bugs are inevitable. Luckily, the devs responds very quickly to bug reports and they have plenty of hotfixes almost everyday. Although, some bugs are still not fixed nor acknowledged (e.g. you can go out from the duel room after you begin the battle, you can get stuck underneath your landing craft's ramp, stuck on mission report page, update failed bug, etc.). They probably only fix bugs that are reported constantly or mass-reported, or maybe it's difficult for them to diagnose the issue so it'll take more time to fix.\\nGameplay also feels a bit 'grindy'. You need to grind for a long time for almost anything. Your team will be able to literally finish anything in-game with the right coordination and equipments, so there's not that many challenge yet if you do have a great team. It will take a pretty long time to reach this phase (more money you spent = faster progress) so don't worry about running out of things to do until then. I would suggest to refrain yourself from buying everything with platinums (real money) so that you have some goals to reach. To be fair, it's what you do on almost every single multiplayer game out there. Grinding. You grind for MMR in Dota. You grind for ranks in CSGO. It's what keeps you playing - you need to have a goal to pursue.\\nGraphics and animations are (IMHO) top-notch. There are not that many games out there that can compete with Warframe's smooth fighting animations. Warframe's abilities animations also looks super dope. Have a barely-enough specs? Don't worry, Warframe is well-optimized since it can run on mid-class (i5 2GHz, 4GB RAM, NVidia 700/800 series) Gaming laptops really smoothly. It still looks pretty good even with the lowest settings. The only issue I have with graphics is when Mutalist Captain Vor came out. I always experience a significant FPS drop everytime he pops out even with my way-more-than-adequate specs. \\nWhat about the connections and player base? Don't worry about player base, you'll find tons of players as long as you keep your acceptable matchmaking ping reasonable. I play on one of the worst place to play online games - South East Asia (not a lot of gamers, terribly slow internet, expensive computer stuff due to import tax) for 4 months a year and I can enjoy the game just like when I'm in US. Pay attention to the amount of open squads in a mission if you want someone to join your game. Missions lacking good rewards often don't have any players playing it. As for the server connections, it's a bit more complicated. Just like Call of Duty, you need to have a Moderate or Open NAT in order to play with others. Setting NAT is definitely not with one push of a button so it might make some players frustrated. Connection also have multiple bugs that haven't been fixed, so be patient when you see everyone in your friend list offline or 'Network Not Responding' keep popping up.\\nNew players - including myself back in 2014 - often get discouraged to play the game as soon as we see the market. Everything needs platinum. New players didn't know about blueprints. They don't know about how easy it is to get the resources required for almost everything that can be crafted. They don't know about trading. This is one of the main disadvantage of Warframe. Devs need to make the game more 'interesting to see' for new players, not make it look like a Pay-To-Win F2P MMO just like others.\\nWarframe is NOT pay-to-win at all. You can only progress faster by paying, but it doesn't make you stronger than others. I know it's kind of tedious to farm for a Warframe, especially Prime ones. It's where the trading system kicks in. Warframe has a trading system. You can sell your Prime Parts found in Fissure missions for Platinums (in-game premium currency bought with real money). You don't need to spend a penny to get Platinums - all you have to do is just play fissure missions A LOT, sell your stuff, and you'll get your platinums. You can use it to buy anything you want (except non-tradable items and Prime Accessories), including the newly-released $70 Prime Warframes. As long as you want to do the trading, Warframe is very far from Pay To Win. You can also farm the prime warframes/weapons quite easily with the new fissure system.\\nOverall, Warframe is one of the best F2P game out there. It has great graphics, dope fighting animations, it's NOT pay to win, it has great potential, responsive & communicative developers, well-written story, and engaging gameplay. It does have a lot of bugs and some of them requires you to restart the game. I can tolerate this fact because they do make a lot of changes quickly and they do hotfixes quite often too. A lot of the players also complains that the game still lacks content and they'll have nothing to do after ~2000 hours spent in the game. But with the great devs, I'm looking forward to see what Warframe will become in the future.\\nThank you for reading!\",\n",

       " 'As of June sixth, the devs have released a patch that really fixed a lot of the optimization issues.  I have put over thirty hours into the game in two days.  I\\'d be playing it right now-- but I\\'m currenty at a place where the net\\'s just not that great so I have to wait. (Unfortunately, might I add.)  That being said; a review.\\nThe game is, to put it frankly, fun.  It\\'s pretty.  Animations are GENERALLY great.  The AI for the dinosaurs could use some tweaking-- I\\'d like to see the specific species given a little more flavor that\\'s more for them and the supposed personalities they\\'ll have once the game\\'s fully released; but that\\'s in due time!  So far I feel as though the devs have earned every penny I spent on this game.  It can be challenging going solo, however.  There\\'s an actual sense of progression to the game-- you don\\'t want to run into raptors before you\\'re ready for them.  Though once you\\'re in leather armor you\\'ll be able to go fisticuff with the lower leveled ones to tame them. \\nThere\\'s a few cons to the game, naturally.  I don\\'t personally enjoy the \"Sleeping\" players being in game upon logout-- though I can see why it\\'s a thing.  Personal preference.  Dinosaurs sometimes keep their momentum when you kill them, causing them to artifact or slide or fly away.  Your body can randomly die when logged out. (Either a bug or I logged out outside of my house and froze to death.) There were, of course, the maintenance issues.  There\\'s also the issue of no spots in official servers. (Just play on an unofficial one for now, honestly.)  I\\'ve leveled to 15 three times in this game already, having to start on different servers for various reasons.  However...\\nOnce I was able to run the game with higher settings with no lag-- riding on raptor back has become one of my favorite things to do.  I very, very seriously love just hopping on my raptor\\'s back and exploring.  I cannot wait to see player-made ARK islands.  I have yet to go to the very center of the map, but I\\'ve gone up and down all of the coasts.  Normally, I\\'m one of those players that gets lost in survival games.  The Island presented by the dev team, however, I find is diverse and unique enough that I can pinpoint where I need to go.  If it\\'s a new place, just look at one of the large floating colorful obelisks.  If it\\'s a familiar place-- I know my way around it.  I\\'ve taken to calling this little \\'U\\' shaped portion near my home \"Bronto Valley\" due to the fact it constantly has a Brontosaurus or two within it.  It\\'s just so easy to find my way around just by the natural landmarks alone.  \\nI feel that the crafting leaves a little bit to desire-- and I always welcome more player/dinosaur customization.  I expect that these things will come along eventually, seeing as it\\'s an early access game.  The devs are just fantastic-- and I\\'ve noticed them more often than not commenting on the game\\'s forums helping players and making light jokes.  It is refreshing.  After the furious patching that was done to make the game playable, I do not worry about the developers pulling a Jig and running away with our hopes and money.  Good job, devs.  Keep up the good work.  You\\'ve made me one happy customer.',\n",

You can build on servers that are moderated by admins and exprience the endgame. You can fight, and play with little restriction. However, if you want to get into the \"official\" servers, I would tell you not to buy this game. \\nThe devs are way to focused on balancing non-essential issues like turrets and turtles, when they have a problem that has been going on since the very start of official release. Essentially, there are people who play this game a lot. They have maxed levels, and that is fine. They can, however, transfer from official server to official server...AND THEY KEEP THEIR LEVEL. This includes maps that are brand new. In fact, 3 days after aberration was released, I joined an official server because I thought I would take part in their cash prize to down the new boss. When I joined this server, 3 days after released, there were already max level players who not only had multiple high level tames, but pillared the entire map, making it not only impossible to build, but to even set down a campfire or sleeping bag. In this state, the official servers are literally unplayable. The only base you can build is a raft on a tiny lake, and that is if you can survive long enough eating berries and mushrooms while crafting thatch foundations and throwing them away. There is no administration and moderation of these official servers. It is bad. \\nSo, if you want to get this game to join an unoffical server and have fun with a few friends, fine.

As I run along I\\'m collecting lots of neat stuff but I\\'m only wearing a pair of basic cloth boxers. I have no idea where I\\'m keeping all this crap.\\nDay 2- Decided to put down roots. Tried to perfect my skills and build a house. Got attacked by a Compy but I clubbed it. Three more came over and ate my face.\\nDay 3- Tried to get back to my homestead. Got attacked by a massive crocodile. Tried to go back again. Got eaten by a T-Rex\\'s angry cousin. Tried one more time and got swarmed by gigantic mosquito bugs. This area sucks.\\nDay 4- Magically spawned in a new area. Has to be further north as its cold. And snowing. Got eaten by a big buzzard. Washed ashore in a slightly warmer region of the north. Used my skills that I had been honing while getting my face eaten to build a house. I\\'m currently inside it while two dilophosaurus try to bust the door in and eat my face. These guys are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\\nDay 5- After cowering in fear during the night I finally decided to grow a pair and protect my measly thatch house. The dilophosaurs ate my face. Made it back to the house and killed the smaller of the two. Decided to make a slingshot and fight the other from a distance and put my ridiculous amount of rocks to good use. A few good shots to the dome and the female is unconscious. \\nDay 6- Fed the knocked out Dilophosarus some raw meat and Narcoberries. When she came too she started following me around like a lost puppy. Named her Popcorn. She might be a good companion since she\\'s 20 levels higher than me.\\nDay 7- Popcorn saved me. Got ambushed in the forest behind my house by more of those annoying little Compy things. I\\'d like to think I helped weaken them with my club but ultimately Popcorn killed all three while I lay in the fetal position wounded and crying like a baby. At least they didn\\'t eat my face.\\nDay 10- The last few days have been pure bliss. Popcorn and I have been roaming the area establishing our dominance by killing smaller, weaker things. We\\'re collecting the hides in preparation for taming and saddling up a Trike. Irrigation is established and I\\'m trying to farm. Life is good and my face hasn\\'t been eaten.\\nDay 12- Tragedy has struck as Popcorn has been killed. As we were scouring the area for hides we came across a turkey. I was hungry. So was Popcorn. We attacked and things seemed to be going well. Until a giant tortoise looking dino with spikes on its shell decided to help the stupid turkey. I got disoriented trying to lead the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off tortoise away. Surely my Level 40 Popcorn would be ok against a level 6 turkey. Alas she wasn\\'t. The turkey ate my dinosaur =(\\nDay 13- Went out in search of a new companion. Found and tamed another female dilophosaurus and named her CapriSun. Caught a male traveling with her and named him Popcorn in honor of my fallen friend. CapriSun and Popcorn part deuce have already saved me by protecting me from two other dilophosaurs that attacked me while I was unconscious from a scorpion bite.

Initial patches to the game were frequent and content-loaded, but very rapidly changed.  These patches became further and further apart while also containing less each time.  Patch notes would often contain hyped-up items only to be removed right before the patch was to be released (some of which have been in this state for nearly a year).  The worst part though, was the very clear lack of any basic testing.  Patches would be released without concern to what it broke or what problems it would cause, which would result in a lot of frustrated players having to deal with the consequences of the developers incompetence and a lot of hot fixes to resolve the problems (which usually broke other things in the process).\\nAll of this could be lived with through the early access stage, I knew what I was getting into when deciding to support the company with their incomplete game.  However, this company has repeatedly shown a concerning disregard for their customers by diverting company assets to other projects.  This started out with simple game modes and integration of popular mods into the main game, however it has led to the release of a much more polished DLC.  A DLC that WildCard expects customers to pay for, while the base game remains incomplete.\\nNot only has this very clearly demonstrated WildCard's lack of ethics, it sends a very disturbing message for gaming as a whole -- charging for game content before the game is even released is ok.

SEPERATE THE CODING. Let PVE be PVE, and let PVP change constantly with the inevitable nerfs that resolve exploits. And so we come to the April Fool's update. How appropriate, because it is a joke, indeed. Developers swung the nerf bat extra hard this time.

You get to actually choose your own frame, \"character\", who comes with it\\'s own special set of abilites, and apart from that, you have 3 groups of weapons you get to choose from for a wide experience, and a unique way to build and augument them to make them all stronger. The multitude of tasks and missions will surely keep you busy and entertained, and if farming is your specialty (get dem argon crystals, boys), even better!\\nAs much as the game may get repetitive, you have several quests to take care of, and soon you will discover the actual storyline going on behind that will end up getting you even more addicted; each one of these quests unlocking new features, such as having your own companions to aid you in battles.\\nAs I am a sucker for high quality graphics and detailed landscapes, Warframe left me breathless. From smooth, ship surfaces to rough asteroid tilesets and robotic designs, you will never get bored of looking around and telling yourself \"these graphics are totally slayin it\".\\nLong story short, if you wanna be a space ninja alien thingy, shoot and slash things, be bombarded with a ton of game lore for you to piece it together, see pretty things or just brag that you have the prettiest frame (fashionframe ftw), this F2P is definitely for you!\\nAnd now, on to farming some more argon crystals for myself... :\\'I',\n",

It has some small flaws here and there, and getting well aquainted with its wikia pages is a must, but otherwise it has a great dev team that stays well connected with is community. The devs also are fairly transparent by way of including weekly livestreams concerning upcomming content and the state of the game.\\nWell what are you waiting for? Pick it up and give it a go!',\n",
       " 'The game was good.  It still has a lot of bugs that need to be sorted.  The biggest problem this game has at the moment is that it has DLC available and it still has not left early access due to bugs in the base game.\\nHow can you produce a expansion to a game that is not finished being developed yet?   This should be default content due to the \"Early Access\" state of the game.\\nEnough about that though. Here is my biggest issue with this game and the \"support\" software you are required to install just to play.  \\nThe anti-cheat software requires you to install a program that starts with windows, monitors all your open applications, monitors your keystrokes and data sent via your computer to anywhere.  We do get a promise that this information (that is sent to a dedicated server) will never be used in negative ways or to steal your information.  But any monitoring software that runs and logs keystrokes is a very very bad idea.\\nBasically if this information is there.. It is a danger to anyones security and privacy.  This information in any form...   It only takes one mistake and a devious person to get access to the system, be it intentionally or by accidental access (letting someone use a computer that is logged into the server.)  Voila someone could have all your passwords / card numbers etc.  So any software that monitors my pc 24/7 will never be installed.  (that means the anti-cheating system ARK insists on.)\\nIf I could get a refund for my game I would take it immediately.  I have no intention of letting that kind of monitoring be installed on my pc.  I would rather get repeatedly ganked and killed in game by cheaters than install that kind of monitoring software.  (If it only ran with the game it would not be so bad.)\\nI develop programs on my pc. I use virtual machines to test things and monitor how the pc is performing... This is how i tested the ARK anti-cheat software.  (I wiped the install of windows after i saw what it was doing and that it would not remove.  It caused me to kill a VM and install to remove it.)\\nSo in conclusion I say NO do NOT buy this game.\\nNB: I have never used cheats or hacks in ARK.  Whats the point of cheating to avoid playing a game?',\n",
       " 'DO NOT BUY ARK: SURVIVAL EVOLVED!\\nOn the games merits, it\\'s okay. It\\'s another \"Eat every five seconds, or starve to death. And drink. And make sure you aren\\'t arbitrarily hot or cold at any given point\". The game is horribly unoptimized, to the point that it becomes a pain to play. Constant hitching (it would kill you if you played online with other people), even on Ultra the game looks like it\\'s own low.\\nLet\\'s also not mention the fact that the game is incredibly tedious to play. Dinosaur taming can take anywhere from a real ten minutes to real hours. I don\\'t know how many hours because I just ramped up the taming so that I could tame things easier on my single player save file. You\\'re forced to sit there, and babysit this dinosaur for who knows how long while anything at any given time can come up, whack it once on the head, and kill it. Imagine doing that on a highly populated PVP server. Standing next to your T-Rex, stuck full of Narcotic arrows while you shove more narcotics down it\\'s gullet and it slowly, oh so slowly, eats meat. And a tribe of dwarfs (real people, mind you) comes along and one-shots it and gangs up on you and says \"lel, noob\".\\nFinally, lets not forget the most egregious example of bad development during Early Access: Paid DLC. The game isn\\'t even out yet, and the ARK devs decide to release a $20 DLC. That\\'s only $10 less than the base game. The game is still unoptimized. The game is still unfinished. The game is still boring in most cases and extremly grindy, not fun in a lot of cases. But the ARK devs do not care about you. They do not care that you have problems with your game or that you want something to change. They only want you to keep funneling them money by buying their lame DLC.\\nDo not support such low practices from developers. Do not support these developers by giving them more money. Do not let them think this is okay. Let them see how wrong they are by letting the only thing they care about, their wallet, suffer.\\nEDIT: The inherent issue with ARKs DLC is that it shows how widely divided and unfocused the ARK devs are. For months now, we\\'ve been getting these... \"things\" that make me question whether or not the ARK devs are actually working on the game (it was supposed to be finished in June 2016. It\\'s currently September 2016. Where is it?). Survival of the Fittest (a terrible, combat focused side game. The one thing this game needs is more PVP), the Center map (whille a cool addition, doesn\\'t need to be made. It probably could have been added to the main map in some way or another) and finally, Scorched Earth (a paid DLC that adds so little you question why it costs $20). They probably had to release Scorched Earth to try and make up for the lawsuit that they got hit with (and lost) a few months back.\\nIf you like the company making your game to get a lawsuit, lose said lawsuit and release unfinished, buggy DLC for an unfinished, buggy game, you\\'ve come to the right place.',\n",

       " \"Warframe simply put is a solid, well rounded video game. I spent a while trying to sum it up with a genre but it borrows from several. Mass Effect with jumping! It's a third person shooter/brawler that puts you in the role of a Tenno, a nearly extinct race awaking to find several factions ruining the galaxy and various shenanigans occuring that are for your detriment. Going on missions in various space stations, ships and planets using tons of weapons and warframes in a free2play game that looks and plays like a current gen AAA game.\\n+ Good Graphics & Sound Design\\n+ Large amound of varied enemies, unique styles and boss battles.\\n+ Procedurally generated maps with dozens of tile sets.\\n+ Very satisfying gunplay and indepth melee combat/combo system.\\n+ Fantastic replay value.\\n+ Hundreds of weapons covering all different categories and type & Plenty of warframes to get with very unique abilities.\\n+ Decent story and universe created.\\n+ F2P\\n- Lack of direction to new players after initial quests.\\n- Late game can slowly get repetetive.\\n- Minor inconveniences to be had if not spending any real money.\\n- PvP is currently Peer2Peer and very laggy with no tangible rewards for putting time into it.\\n- A lot of mechanics go unexplained unless you actively check the codex/wiki.\\nIn essence you are able to progress through hundreds of missions that are instanced for up to 4 players in a squad, completing random objectives in procedurally generated maps against one of the 5 possible enemy factions (or sometimes a combination!) This is a solid formula, with a lot of different planet/map tilesets, a ton of very well crafted rooms and a very hefty roster of enemies for each of the main faction. Combine this with the hundreds of weapons you can craft (varying from pistols to grenade launchers to crossbows to electric boomerangs to rail guns), 20+ warframes (classes with very unique 4 abilities, akin to a MOBA) to choose from, a very good looking engine and some solid gunplay/melee combat and you've got a fantastic game in it's own right. You level up and upgrade all of your gear with mods that drop from enemies constantly, so everyone can tailor their weapons and warframe to their own liking and you do get a very solid sense of progression. You can parkour around the maps, wall run, pull of some complex melee combos and act like a space ninja, or you can be moving from cover to cover, co-ordinating with your team and playing it through like a tactical third person shooter. \\nIt has a very good looking engine that stands up by todays standards depiste the game being nearly 3 years old (counting the closed beta) It's got a godly particle system, as well as full usage of PhysX, very cool looking units and maps and a consistent art style throughout. The sound design is very competent but the music stands out the most, there are several dynamic sound tracks when fighting each of the factions that change depending on how much combat is happening but they all sound very unique and cool to listen to in the middle of some hectic shenanigans.\\nThe kicker being that this is completely free to play. This is a hybrid co-op/MMO without the 1-9 button smashing on the keyboard and it relies entirely on your skill with the weapons, abilities and movement to be good. It being a F2P MMO esque game, you do have to craft new weapons and warframes which take time but due to how inherently fun the actual gameplay is, farming for materials or blueprints never feels like a chore and 99% of the time you'll be collecting more than enough materials just while playing normally. There's a ton of PvE mission types, some new PvP, horde modes, a space combat mode (think zone of the enders) and plenty of replay value inbetween. \\nThere are several story quests and tutorial missions to all new players a grasp on all of the basic mechanics however once the tutorials are over you are just sort of left to your own devices. The lack of constant direction might annoy a few players but I strongly reccomend just deciding that you want to go and check out a planet or get a cool weapon then work toward those goals, seeing new things and acquiring more equipment on the way. Planets have bosses, new planets need to be unlocked and so on so there are tangible goals to set yourself. You can create a clan with your friends, build a very large Dojo that can be used for trading, researching exclusive weaponry, dueling, storing event trophies as well as assisting in building solar rails for the very large scale PvP solar rail conflicts. \\nI would reccomend if you're really into it getting just a few dollars worth of platinum then buying a scarf, they're cool, because it's in space.\",\n",
       " 'For a free game, I had a lot of fun playing this. It\\'s better than I thought it would be.\\nThe Gameplay is great. It plays quite well, even with a Steam Controller. The Parkour, while feeling kind of limited, it makes you feel like a badass. Now mixing Parkour with a Third-Person Perspective, and you are in for something epic, gory, and fun that is free. If you though that Black Ops III\\'s Parkour was fun (which is not imo), think again.\\nThings called \"Mods\" lets you customize the strengths of your weapons, which makes combat much more easier on higher rank enemies. A lot of levels and worlds to check out. You name it.\\nThe game does have some flaws, though. Using my Steam Controller on some menus are unpolished. I couldn\\'t get out of a Success Screen, even though I was pressing B. When selecting a level, you want members to play with you, right? It shows that pressing \"X\" will make it so you wait for some people, but it turns out you have to press \"A\" twice on the level you want to do in order to wait. Yah...\\nOver and all, I can\\'t recommend this game enough! Come on, it\\'s free!',\n",
       " 'Warframe. I\\'ve come back to this game countless times when other F2Ps went bad. Digital Extremes is certainly interested in more than just profit, but in my honest opinion, that\\'s certainly always debatable. For now, I\\'ll go over the game and the company behind it.\\nWarframe\\'s gameplay, at its core, is quite fluid. You can cut enemies to bits with your melee weapons, shoot them apart with ranged weapons, and even approach a situation with stealth. However, exploration is fairly painful at best. At its worst, well, I\\'ve had moments of rage inducing issues with exploring the map as it currently is.\\nThe controls respond quite well, and you get used to them within the hour. The way you move through your environment depends on how you wish to traverse it. Simply running across terrain, wall running or climbing to get to high places or past distance gaps in the floor, or even the new Bullet Jump system that has been implemented to get more distance.\\nHowever, I would like to note that there are some ways to quickly traverse short distance simply using a rolling double jump or a roll slide. Having played this game for so long, playing catch-up with your more experienced allies is unenjoyable at best, so memorize this: Tap shift, and immediately hit control. Or tap shift and immediately jump. It covers distance quite nicely.\\nThe weapon variety in this game is absolutely rediculous! Why is it rediculous? Because there\\'s over 150 weapons in the game! Including \"Primed\" versions\". There are over 30 different frames as well, also including \"Primed versions\".\\nThe weapons go from automatic rifles like the Dera and Braton to powerful shotguns like the Tigris and Hek, to explosive-launchign pistols such as the Angstrum and Kulstar, to even whipes and blades such as the Lecta whip and Gram heavy sword. \\nWarframes provide very interesting choices as well. I\\'ve found myself enjoying Rhino Prime for his ability to soak up alot of damage. While other frames do it better, his abilities on display help him outshine others. I find myself using his Iron Skin with the Iron Shrapnel augment, which basically makes him a human claymore. His ultimate ability, \"Rhino Stomp\", also initially named \"Radial Stomp\" suspends enemies in a form of stasis, stick in the air. Jopkingly I\\'ve called it \"Hammer Time\".\\nMods are indeed in the game, but not as game modifcations like one would expect. Instead, they are cards you can use to increase the performance or your weapons, warframe, sentinel and/or Kubrow. You can get mods that increase helath, shields and armor, mods for powers, status effects and durations, and mods for mobility. Weapons have plenty of interesting mods to make for very fun builds, if making custom weapon builds is a preference you have.\\nYou can even make a rocket launcher a silent weapon with the use of a sound supression mod. Warframes can also get syndicate and Conclave-locked mods known as \"Augment Mods\", which add a bonus effect or power to each Warframe ability, however there isn\\'t a mod for all 4 for any of the Warframes yet. Having said all of this, weapon and character variety is certainly not in shortage.\\nDigital Extremes has been a standard to which I have judged most Free to Plays that have come out thus far. They put time and effort into their work. More than most companies ever do as a matter of fact. However, as this is a free to play game, like any company running a free to play, they must have a way to make profit. They do so with a very fair model. Almost everything in the gam,e can be gotten without paying a dime if you don\\'t go merchantile. The only things that can be purchased specifically with Platinum, the premium currency,\\nWhile the company has always been a ccused of questionable actions, Their handling of situations has gone fairly well. Being honest to their players and giving all the information they can to keep the community in the loop with them. They also do this through their weekly thursday night Prime Time streams, as well as their bi-weekly Friday afternoon Devstreams, which give out free 1000 Platinum rtewards during each of the aforementioned Devstreams.\\nLike any othe rgame, perfection is always the big lie. I\\'ll put up my complaints with the various parts of the game to let you all know what you possibly may deal with.\\n1. Repitition\\nThis is the biggest problem in the game so far. Repitition. You\\'ll likely burn out before you make enough progress to be content is you always use the same weapons and Warframe. For this reason, variety is deeply encouraged, so make sure to grow your arsenal of equipment as much as you can.\\n2. Balance and Effect\\nThis is a massive problem, not about weapons, but about the Warframes. Some are clearly well-designed for their purpose, while others, having been the first designed for that purpose are outshined by others. Mag gets my attention here, as her ability to perform anything in the game is continually dewbuffed to being next to worthless. Hydroid and one or two other frames suffer from this issue as well, reducing their worth to little more the Master Experience fodder.\\n3. The Map\\nI\\'ve complained about this once, and I\\'ll do it again. This thing is a nightmare to navigate. The only thing they so far have done to improve it is a full-on map layout to see where you\\'re going a little more. However, the issue of vertical detection on the map is still a fairly large problem, as it does not separate floor by flor. I already mentioned the idea of making a Metroid Prime-esque map system to replace the current one, but so far as I know, it remains on the back burner instead of where things are in need of adjustment.\\n4. The Grind.\\nGood GODS the grind. This is a traumatic experience at best, anbd most likely where you\\'ll burn out while trying to collect prime parts and just give up. While DE claims to be trying to lessen the grind, I fail to see that. In fact, I see the exact opposite happening here, as well as in certain other place with Warframe, in addition to nerfing certain mods, certain powers, and never certain guns that need it. This is where the game flops from a 7 story building flat on its face. While not anywhere worse than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from Firefall or Spiral Knights, it\\'s still arguably frustrating from time to time if not often.\\nMy thoughts on the game vary, but as you can see from my collective hours, I certainly lean more toward recommending it, if not a bit hesitantly.\\n8.5 Weapon/character/pet variety\\n9.0 Gun/swordplay\\n10 Movement fluidity\\n4.0 Replayability\\n100% Free to play, as advertised.\\nOverall, I\\'d give Warframe an 8 out of 10.

       " \"While I did enjoy this game, I am deeply disappointed on how things are progressing. \\nThe game is fun, yet unfinished. It might be unfair to complain about an early access game that is unfinished, but one has to wonder how an early access can have DLC. \\nThe game still needs optimizing, strong PCs get inconsistent frame rates, server is a chore to set up and needs consistent tinkering... I know , normal stuff for an early access... yet they have the time to develop a DLC. \\nWhen I decided to spend money for this game it was against the promise that the game will be finished, I expect it to be finished as soon as the developer is able to do so...but the developer is more concerned on how to squeeze every extra bit of cash from its supporters by launching a DLC for a game still in early access. \\nI don't understand why Steam allows such a thing. I don't mind paying for a DLC for a FINISHED game, but now I'm finding myself in the situation where I am a supporter for this game since its launch on Steam not being able to enjoy the full product as it requires DLC in EARLY ACCESS. \\nMind you , the DLC is installed on my PC, they force it in an update, yet I can't play it while it's using 8GB of my space. \\nIf gamers are accepting this from the devs we might as well just add a subscription to Early Access games where they can take whatever they wish from our credit cards with every patch. \\nNO, I don't care that the DLC brings a lot of new stuff to the table, I don't care that some people consider that this game is worth more, finish the fracking game and then add DLC!\",\n",

Lazy devlopment and now that is releasing they again are messing with the player base and punishing those that played long hours in Alpha and jacked the price up. I really think they don't care about their clients. In a game about dinos they are now capping number of dinos a tribe can have and making long time servers legacy without customer support. Overpriced for a 2 year early access game that now is charging 60.00 for something that was 6.00 a few months ago.\",\n",
       " 'So I just got off of a server, a guy with a 30 dodo army came up to my house. So what? The dodos, they slapped my walls, as they were slowly darkening the horror sunk in. I was a goner. As my walls collapsed the hope of escape went with it, I was surrounded, by dodos. As the dodos closed in on me I was saved by a player on a Argy, he picked me up out of my house and we flew away. He said nothing when I thanked him for saving me from my doom, we were going very far away from any place the dodo army couldn\\'t reach. He flew me entirely across the map with no breaks, and I realised where we were going. My name was Pepperoni at the time, the player stops and says one thing; \"I aem goinng tu cook u into a pizza\" and drops me into a volcano, (On The Center) and I was sure as I was falling I was about to die, but no, I was grappled into a cave in the volcano, and pulled back to safety.

And all the people complaining about Fps and stuff are just new gen gamers born with a silver PS4 controller in their hands. I play on a quite literal potato around 15 fps (if im lucky) and I still play for 700+ hours right now. All the negative votes right now are from some dumb controversy about them releasing Scorched Earth (A baller dlc) in early access, if they want to release it, they can release it yo. Scorched earth adds mythological stuff including DRAGONS and MANTICORES and GOLEMS and LITTLE KANGAROO RATS THAT ARE REALLY CUTE AND I DREAM ABOUT HAVING A REAL LIFE PET ONE AND NAMING IT DREAMCRUSHER LIMBTEARER THE THIRD! (Basically Australia simulator 2016) But really, Im not sure why people are complaining about it, its a fully working dlc, and this game really isnt very \"early access-y\" anyway, and thats a good thing. When it is fully released we have more amazing content to look forward to. Anyway, back to reviewing. If youre one of those people that for some reason gets *TRIGGERED* when something to do with dinosaurs isnt 100% accurate, such as the dinos not having feathers, I dont want giant chickens chasing me around, dodos are enough... too much... and Im not saying that a giant rex with feathers wouldnt be terrifying as hell chasing me, but It would kinda just ruin the feel for me... And its a fantasy game anyway, with giant spiders, giant yeti things, and dragons! So dont get triggered, is what im saying if youre looking to play this game. Other then that, official servers are infuriatingly hard, but play on them if youre just starting out, so if you succeed you can go get bragging rights at walmart for 50% off! And devs btw, if youre reading this for some weird reason, please add 2x, 5x, and 10x multiplier official servers! :D Its hard to find good servers with neat multipliers... But if you get angered and start looking at your pet fish menacingly (Im not sure why you would do that, but hey, I need to lengthen this review so I can look smart!) Anyway, you should get this map. Theres some really amazing workshop mods including Annunaki Genisis, Aku Shima, Ark Advance, Dino Overhaul, Mystic Academy, Jurrasic Ark, etc etc etc\\nThere are a ton of different dinosaurs, mammal things, prehistoric things, and they all look amazing :D A warning though, if youre new to the game, I feel as if alot of people need a warning to this, if you see a dinosaur (Rex, Raptor, or Carno (btw its Carnotaurus, not Carnosaurus)) thats colored red, black, or white and has some perpetual cloud of cheeto dust around it, its an alpha dinosaur. Theyre many times stronger than their normal counterparts and really will destroy you if you try and go give one a nice hug and calm it down. And no, you cant tame them. But this is turning more into a guide then a review now :c So basically, get the game, expect low fps, dont ragequit, and dont drink and drive.',\n",

       " \"After a single mounted saber tooth destroyed my tribes house and all of our belongings, I decided it was time to head out and be a nomad. Fully expecting to die on this journey, I didn't pay attention to where I was going, but took off. The first night consisted of making myself some armor and tools. After crafting a spear and collecting all the meet I could carry, I was off. The first day was a roller coster of emotions and close calls as I roamed the island from supply drop to supply drop. With each new loot box, I became more powerful and cautiously optimistic that this would work out. I found myself well armed and starving atop a mountain with a few parachutes I had just collected.\\nI did the only logical thing and dove off the mountain, soaring across a ravine and past brontosaurs like a scene from jurassic park. I landed next to another supply drop, and to my surprise, found the makings of a decent wooden house.\\nWith the ability to make a small abode, I decided traveling alone had gotten lonely, so i used my bow and tranq arrows to take down a small dilo, that would be named Mr. Spitter. Life was good, we traveled together and became close friends. Mr. Spitter had my back and I had his, but all of my gear had gotten too heavy, and the little dilo couldn't help much. It was time for a mount.\\nThe only mount of choice for a wander in this game is the raptor, its speed and lethality make it a perfect traveling companion. with some time and hunting, I brought down a raptor and tamed it slowly. So slowly, im fact, that I got Mr. Spitter a mate, and hunted with them while my raptor was tamed. I returned to the raptor just before he became a loyal companion to place my new forged saddle on him and rode off into the sun.\\nUsually this would be the happy ending, but in all survivor games like this one, there is no happy ending. Either you quit while you're content, or you live long enough to see everything taken from you. My new family and i traveled together until I found a supply drop under water. With the loot pulling me forward like a moth to a flame, I dove in the river and my trusty companions followed me in. Little did I know what lurked beneath the surface. Piranha swarmed us and devoured Mr. Spitter alive before I could even react. I pulled out my spear just in time for my second dilo to die. I couldn't let Speedy, my raptor, suffer the same fate. In a flurry of thrusts, I managed to save Speedy by a hair. The loot that laid inside contained the remaining pieces i needed for a house. \\nFilled with sorrow, I decided it was time to head home and rebuild a base for my tribe, but I soon realized I was lost. Speedy and I roamed for hours searching for landmarks to guide us home. I finally found the path home and eagerly followed the beach along the river to where I could rest for the night. Speedy was tired from running, and we were both to the limits of what we could bare to carry. I decided to give speedy a break and jump off, just to luckily find a stegosaraus egg. I thought it would be nice to return to the tribe with another dinosaur that we could all hatch and train together. I didn't notice the two large dinodaurs who were watching the egg closely, and didn't appreciate a stranger taking their young. THey were on me before I could draw my weapon. I had over encumbered myself, and Speedy counldn't move. I died slowly trying to drop the egg, and received the final blow as i attemted to join speedy to make my get away. As I lay dying on the beach, I watched as Speedy was slowly beaten to death by two enemies he should have never met.\\nMy wishful thinking turned to greed, and lead to dispair. I awoke at the shambles of our base, naked and alone, with nothing left to show for my time on the island.\\nHonestly a great game if you enjoy a true survival format and I highly recomend it to anyone willing to put the time in to get the rewards they want.\",\n",
       " \"Don't get me wrong, this game is overall a very fun experience. It's very addicting and once you tame your first dino you just can't stop until you get bigger and better dino's. The grind can seem a little bit too much at times but you can get onto a private server where most of the modifiers are turned up. Now to address the DLC. I refuse to buy it. How can a developer send out paid DLC before the game is even released fully? I would say it's a huge slap in the face to the gamers who have supported them.

You can play this on unofficial servers where things don\\'t take as long to accomplish, but either way it leads to my primary problem. Those that spend more time than you will always beat you, regardless of your skill. There is such a large spike of power as you progress gaining access to certain dinosaurs and breeding/eggs. \\nThe three servers we have played on have one to three \"alpha tribes\", aka the orignal inhabitants of the server. They are quite friendly to noobies, even gifting you awesome gear for your status. Once you become somewhat of a threat they become hostile and start imposing \"rules\" or some form of control. \\nAt this point you are forced to their will or you get erased. I have a prime example. The server my friends and I play on had this happen yesterday. There is one alpha tribe of the server. \"Some one\" killed the leaders flying mount. He gets a Titanosaur and literally erradicates the two most advanced tribes on the server simply because he can. Their characters will maintain their levels, but all their manifested work is 100% erased because some guy got mad. They lost literally 100\\'s of hours of work. \\nI played UO, I love the threat of losing \"work\" because it makes gameplay exciting. This game you don\\'t have a chance of beating the big boy on the block.  Say you are both max level. If you have played 100 hours, and he has played 500, he has 5 Gigas and you have 1. You literally don\\'t have a chance. If you can start pouring in more time than them, they will probably attack you. Most alphas have 1000\\'s of hours played already. \\nThe overlord of my current server has 13 tamed gigas(probably perfect tames + bred) an uncountable amount of other things. Every underwater cave is his. Every river is barricaded. You can\\'t tame a Quetzl without his permission. He has more resources hoarded than you could possibly gather in a month. If you make him angry he will tame a Titanosaur and erradicate you. So what does one do? You can either unite every other person on the server and still probably not even make a dent against him, server hop (as we did 3x now), or quit playing as I have.\\n**Added after original on 8/18**\\nFirst, I want to say the original review is not edited and only this was added. Second, thank you very much for the polite invite to PvE servers and those that tried to remain constructive with other options. I want to PvP a lot so PvE only is just not for me. For the rest, what follows is for you.\\nI honestly did not want to outright bash this game because I did not want to offend anyone, but the gloves are off. This game is GARBAGE. UI/storage/crafting are beyond GARBAGE. Net coding and registration of attacks are GARBAGE. You are honestly going to tell me spending 1000s of hours in left click simulator is fun? Are you good at spamming left click and using Google? Well you can master this game! \\nCombat is AWFUL. This is sub par Skyrim with no abilities or specializations at all. Want to fight in melee? Spam left click and abuse terrain! Want to attack from ranged? Abuse terrain and spam left click! Once you tame your Dino, you spam left click and SOMETIMES even a right click! I have played games all my life and this doesn\\'t even come close to being fun. \\nNot only is combat dull but takes HOURS of prep to get there unles you want to throw primitive weapons at dinosaurs. \\nNow for PvP. This game literally discourages PvP. The odds of me running into some one of my strength is EXTREMELY rare. In fact, with 240 hours played I got in a total of 10 fights at MAX. Only 2 of them were somewhat entertaining, running into a fellow noob and having a jolly chase through the woods with bows and arrows. I came for PvP, and 2 good fights in 240 hours? This game is flat out awful. If I kill a member of a tribe larger than mine, guess what happens? As far as trying to beat an alpha tribe, I\\'ve got better things to do with my life than spend 1000s of hours to beat a nolife. I don\\'t have the time nor the patience for this trash. I am a massive nerd and love games, but this is repulsive. \\nThe only way I personally see people like this is if you are an unexeperienced gamer or cannot get over the psychological thrill of progression and exploration.

You have now completed Ark, no reason to purchase.\\nThe main problem with this game is that it is a griefer survival game, not a dino survival game. There is not even PVP, you just get killed while your offline, that is it. If you compare this to another survival game you dumber than a box of rocks because not every game has to be the same, the devs can chose to do something better and make the game better than the others. I never saw one ad or comment put out by the devs saying, “hey come play this dino game and get killed in your sleep because that is “survival”. \\nPvPvE should be: Players in general engage in PvE however can choose to engage in mutual combat while online or engage in Tribal warfare, all gloves are off.\\nPvE should be: 100% player versus dino with no or little ability to harm another player. Restrict building around mines and resources areas to include other player buildings to eliminate griefing. Provide moderators to kick griefers and delete their characters from the server.\\nHardcore PvP should be: What the game is now. If you are so dang interested in dying while you are at work, at school, eating with your family, or sleeping then this should be the option for you.\\nThe griefers and midnight murderers are too dang spineless and carebear to be a real PvPer and hit the hardcore because at the end of the day, they are just a little ----- who likes to kill new and casual players.\\n-----Update as of 21 June 2015-----\\nI have since moved on to an unofficial server and successfully avoided the toxic nature of the official server griefers, which I honestly believe is sad. Why? Because the official servers should be the most opening to the gaming community by default and not push people away. The “official” server is what most players will click on whether they are new to gaming or survival games or whatever. I have also found that the unofficial server I chose does not generate a large population of players who log on consistently. Simply move you say? I may, but for now I am holding out. The only other problem with a random unofficial server is the ever looming thought; “what if the admin turns the server off?!?” Then your character and all you have built is done for. Try to know your admin in my opinion.\\nTelling the gamers who do not want griefing to simply go on a PvE server cupcake! is not effective. Have you looked at the data? Most players do not want griefing and most of the servers are in fact NOT built for PvE only. Furthermore, those who are suggesting this are assuming we never want to PvP. Wrong! I want to be online when the PvP happens and at least have some kind of story to associate the event with and tell friends about. What do I tell friends now? Go on an official server and you will log in dead--hands down. I hope you like to log in and see your characters cheeky rear because you will get familiar with it. I have also found that PvE servers lower MY FPS and I believe this is because of the hundreds of players logging in, building a hut and then never logging in again. Some of the servers are starting to look like shanty town island and not survival island. Also, there are only 70 spots available on those servers, so you better plan on never playing during prime time.\\nThere does seem to be some reading comprehension issues with some of the community who have left some fairly nasty comments. I am not sure if they even read the entire post or just TL;DR, “you mad bro!?!” Either way--ignorance is not a virtue. I have no problem with people disagreeing but at least be intelligent about it. Please keep that is mind. It is early access and the developers want to know what we think, so I gave my opinion based on my experiences.',\n",

       " \"I started writing a review for why after a year of playing the game, I changed my review for it from recommended to not recommended; and it ended up being far longer than is a reasonable length for a review. It is not the proper forum for me to write four pages as to what happened to the game, and why I can't suggest playing it anymore. If you want to read more on it, I suggest going to the actual forums for the game (not through Steam, but through the official website). The players there are very active in posting, and there will be a lot of threads going in detail about the faults of the game, and talking about how DE's actions have never been further out of sync from what players want from the game, and from the direction they were once taking it.\\nInstead of writing four pages, i'll summarize it into something short and concise. Again, if you want more specifics, feel free to go look into them, but I'll summarize, as I have logged more than enough hours into the game to be very familiar with it, and what has happened.\\nWhat it really boils down to is this:\\nThe company is using grind walls, and severely crowded RNG tables to deliver content. Which is one of the least creative, and worst examples of game design I have ever played. It wasn't originally going to be that way, but that is what it has become now. And considering it is supposed to be an action game, and not an MMO/RPG, the grind really kills the feel of the game, you are much less of a Space Ninja saving the solar system, and more of a mindless drone collecting resources for new weapons, all for literally no reason at all, due to the lack of story. \\nIn my 20 years of gaming experience, I have never seen a company so unwilling to work with what their player base wanted, and just outright ignore them. The community is incredibly vocal with ways to make the game more enjoyable for the players, and keep them interested, and avoid just getting burned out on the game, and patch after patch, they go ignored.\\nFrom the past year of experience with this game, the current state is that it is a fantastic concept, being delivered in one of the worst ways imaginable, by an inadequate design and balance team.\",\n",
       " 'At its core, Warframe is a cooperative mix of traditional third person shooter gameplay, a great parkour system, and good melee combat.  After almost 3 years of active development, it has come a long way from where it started, and for that reason I greatly enjoyed it for over a year.  However, the developer\\'s latest decisions have, in my opinion, completely destroyed the game. To fully explain this I\\'ll need to separate this review into parts, as this a series of events as long as they are disappointing.\\nBand-aid patches may not be the egregious thing DE has done, but they\\'re certainly what have frustrated me and many other players the most.  A band aid patch is when DE attempts to solve a criticism by implementing some feature, usually a mod, that is a half-measure and that doesn\\'t solve the root of the problem.  For example, a new system called Rivens were introduced.  Rivens are modifications for your weapons that can only be obtained via the endgame missions called Sorties, or by buying them.  Once obtained, you must complete a randomized criteria to view which weapon it is for.  Then it will apply 3 positive stats like increased damage, increased magazine capacity, and so on, and one negative stat.  The system was originally intended to stop power creep by providing substantial buffs to underpowered weapons, but instead of doing so it instead just further buffed the meta weapons, created an even longer farm with more reliance on RNG, and in some cases even contracts itself making weapons do \\n. \\nThis is representative of DE\\'s current mentality of trying to solve problems with half measures, and never actually addressing the real problem.  This has been occurring for a substantial period of time, and there is no sign of it ever changing.  Although it may not be the worst thing for new players, I know it infuriates many veterans and it certainly is a large part of why I\\'ve quit Warframe.\\nAs previously mentioned, Warframe suffers from a tremendous amount of power creep.  Due to the prime system and even just new weapons, older weapons are rendered statistically obsolete, being objectively worse in every regard.  While that may not be the majority of weapons, there are many that are unusable past level 30 due to never being profiled buffed, and this includes entire weapon types that are never used and are only obtained for collector\\'s value or the mastery rank system.\\nWarframe does not have a traditional leveling system, but instead opts for what is called \"Mastery Rank\".  Mastery Rank, or MR for short, is the level of a player\\'s account and consequently the level most players associate with being a veteran.  In order to obtain these levels, players must level individual weapons and other items, further increasing the grind and meaning that players have to constantly switch to new weapons.  This honestly isn\\'t a bad idea, as it incentivizes players to change their play style and adapt.  However, weapons and other items needed for leveling have a tendency to be \"vaulted\", or removed from the game, punishing new players and making it harder to find a weapon they like.  If MR was simply a level this would be fine, but features, weapons and warframes, quests, and many other things are locked behind it.  \\nIn Warframe, there are certain weapons and warframes that are \"prime\", meaning they look different and have higher stats.  There are other variations as well, but primes are the most recognizable and sought after.  Because of the way the Relic system and previously the Key system are set up, there can only be a certain number of prime parts in rotation at a given time.  This leads to older parts being \"vaulted\", or in other words removed from the drop table.  After this happens, new players become unable to obtain them unless they either buy them from other players for exorbitant prices as they are in low supply, or wait possibly years for them to return to the game.  When they return, they are available to farm for a single month and are then removed from the drop tables again.  Oh but don\\'t worry, DE\\'s got you covered with a little system called \\n.\\nWhen either a new prime comes out or one is removed from the vault, Prime Access becomes available.  This a system where you can bypass the grind by paying prices that are beyond exorbitant.  At the time of writing this review, the most recent prime is Valkyr Prime.  To simply obtain the primary and melee weapons, it would cost  49.99$ with \"discounted\" plat.  For Valkyr and the weapons it is 79.99$, and for both Valkyr with the weapons and a 49.99$ accessory pack it costs \\n.  People will argue that this is non-essential so it doesn\\'t matter, but I would argue that DE has a vested interest in making the grind as hard as possible so people feel forced to buy this pack, and that making prices so astronomically high they are simply trying to exploit people who will buy anything they put out.  Now, if the grind was reasonable this would be questionable but not a huge deal. But unfortunately, it couldn\\'t be farther from reasonable.\\nThis.  This is what is killing Warframe.  To craft a single warframe, you must first farm for the helmet, chassis, systems, and in some cases blueprint.  Most warframe blueprints can simply be bought from the market with credits, the in-game currency, but some are dropped and some require extensive, resource-intensive quests.  Once you have obtained all four parts, you must craft the helmet, chassis, and systems, using resources ranging anywhere from reasonable to multiple months of farming.  After this, you must wait 12 hours for the parts to finish or you could just pay real money to skip the process.  Then, once the parts have all finished you must craft the warframe itself.  This process takes 72 hours to complete.  Once finished, you must buy another warframe slot, and the only way to do this is to pay with the premium currency, \\n.  You can obtain the premium currency, called platinum, by trading with other players, but doing so is time-consuming and will yield very little unless you are trading highly valuable items which you cannot obtain until far later into the game.  Once you have done this, you will finally have your finished warframe.  This process is greatly exasperated for primes.  \\nFor normal warfames, you obtain their individual parts by fighting the same boss over and over and hoping RNG gives you the part you need.  For primes, this is instead replaced by having to use keys which are obtained by RNG to complete specific missions to receive a drop based on RNG.  So much of Warframe is based upon RNG, and it is a large part of why the grind is so bad.  Thankfully the current prime system is better, but you can still expect to spend a while farming certain frames.  In the old system, I once farmed 12 entire hours for a single piece of a single weapon.  However, the new prime system hasn\\'t solved everything.  Drops are still dictated by RNG and things like me having run the same mission 50 times to get a single warframe have not been changed, and many systems still impede progress all in an attempt to force you to pay.  For a game that is praised for having a fair business model, there is an extreme emphasis on tiring you out with the grind.\\nThis current review isn\\'t even half of what I set out to state.  There are just so many things fundamentally wrong with this game that have never and will never be addressed.  The developer is complacent in making bad decision after bad decision and making money off the backs of what few people they still have on their side.  While it may not be as extreme an example as many other games, it\\'s still disheartening and downright sad to see a game with so much potential go down this path.',\n",

Oberon was my first frame, and my favorite, and I spent a lot of time researching and creating a fit to make that frame great again. It took a few weeks to do, but I finally did it, though to my misfortune the cards I used were heavily nerfed, the weapons I used were also heavily nerfed, and the frame was nerfed again. Really everything I had worked for just became useless, and while yes I understand the game is in Beta and it has \"balance changes\" all the time, it still hurts.\\nThese dramatic changes to the game really ruined it for me.

(Building pain, Survival is kinda of not a game aspect post the first day of play.  Lots of maintenance time sinks)   Dino feeding chores or they stave if you are offline to long,  Massive breeding time sinks where you have to be online non stop for over 24 hours to get it done.  Taming times can be insane.  Now you can go private server and adjust setttings.

Information as to what all was entailed in the addtion of Battleye via ARK (Wildcard)  wasn\\'t really laid out prior to the patch it came in with.\\nWildcard (ARK devs)  Drops this 3rd party software into their patch.  Battleye has all of its files put in place on your root drive, as well as within the ARK directories.  Basically all the parts of being installed minus a single command to imbed it into your kernal.\\nOn launching ARK you were prompted to Accept Battleye EULA. (Note the EULA was not listed to read it was buried in a file on your hard-drive basically hidden.)    So you were blind to what you were accepting basically.  Simply because it did not load or show up,  Battleye Devs said basically \"well its on your drive read it\"  Yeah....   The EULA stated \"upon installation of battleye you accept the EULA\"   Ironically the files are placed onto your drive, before you even were able to accept the EULA so you are forced to accept the EULA...    Devs say that putting Exicutables ect on your drive is not a installation.... yeah I call BS.    Even if you hunted down the files and removed them.  Each patch places those files right back onto your PC.  So you get to hunt down the files in multiple locations to remove them.   Also to note,  Battleye is installed at the Kernal level,  So to remove you have to have above normal PC experience to stop and delete services from Admin control command prompty via tryped commands.   Also to note, Battleye is self updating with no prompting and can change its operation as per what ever the Battleye devs decided to change it too.   Its a Very Large backdoor into your PC plain and simple.  Ironically they are quick to post saying their intentions are good and the strive to protect our info.  Yet they legally won\\'t place that into you know legal privacy statement or EULA......  Ironic\\nSo Battleye has a good bit of negitive crap on the net,  Battleye Devs claim its all hackers trash talking their service.  I wholely think the mass majority of it is crap stirred up by hackers.   But the Battleye Devs, are pretty much disrespectful to people with concerns.

But off course, if your not PRO battleye you are just \"Criticizers\" as per Battleye.  Basically everyone is a evil hacker and your not allowed to be just a player with concerns about their privacy.  Simply put the Battleye Devs are very passonate, but quick to aggression, un-professional and speak down to anyone with concerns.   Also note,  Battleye itself has been hacked so lets hope their not comprimised and we pay the price for the backdoor into our PC is not misused.\\nNon-Professional Devs in conduct and community communication (Battleye)  is the last people I would want to have a backdoor into my PC and my trust.\\nWhat Does battleye do? \\nBattleye Reads anything saved and ram,  If its in ram it can read it copy it and send it to the Battleye servers and saved.  Keep in mind, You have no idea what was sent, how long its stored, nor when they do it.  Also to keep in mind anything you do on your PC is copied into ram and left, as most programs ect do no unload from ram.  So  anything you have done that sit in RAM is fair game to Battleye.  Check some banking?   Hey look RAM saved info! \\nFile scanning?  Yeah pretty much no matter how you slice it, its allowed and can/will sifting through files.  Supposedly only Hacking files.....but they have stated sometimes other files get sent was well.....  \\nEULA is 100% protect Battleye and you have no leg to stand on or protection.  They have no Privacy Statement to protect your information (Check out steam they have a nice one to protect us)  But Battleye doesn\\'t want to be responsible if their software causes your information to be hacked or stolen via battleye\\'s own software backdoor on your PC.  Let alone the files the send to their servers (the ones we don\\'t get to see or approve) if those are stolen well tough luck battleye is safe your not.  \\nMaybe in time Battleye will step up and join the world of professional upstanding companies, but to me they are as bad as hackers.

       " 'EDIT: \\nThis review is a bit outdated, but the situation is pretty much the same, if not worse.\\nGame might seem fun in the beginning, but I would not recommend trying it as it quickly turns into horrible grind where you have to pay if you don\\'t want to play hundreds of hours of the same missions to see if you are lucky, and if you are - go grind for resources now (which also in many cases takes quite a bit of time) and after that wait several days until the item is built.\\nBut then at some point you are either burnt or unlucky and you just pay, as you get what you are looking for instantly and already built. With each update devs look for new ways to make you do that, while saying \\'yeah, we want to decrease the grind, sure\\'.\\nOriginal review here:\\nI guess it was fun while it lasted. It\\'s hard for me to write this after so long.\\nTo begin with, the game has great community and still has a lot of potential if many core issues are fixed.\\nWe started playing Warframe with my friends when it was not on Steam yet, like almost 4 years ago. None of them play it anymore just because of glaring issues that you begin to see after some time.\\nDevelopers are focusing mostly on new content no matter what. Game design issues that were in the game from the beginning are simply ignored or a band-aid fix is released which doesn\\'t adress the issue itself. Broken enemy armor and health scaling, useless weapons and Warframes aka mastery fodder, energy management is non existant, most warframe abilities either useless and nobody ever uses them or OP due to superb CC capability or straight invulnerability etc. and at some point get nerfed without buffing other abilities to compensate and so on.\\nEvery once in a while devs introduce a new system just to forget it for next year or two. Two-three weeks after it\\'s been released and almost nobody uses it, and there\\'s a plenty of such cases (Archwing, Dark Sectors, Conclave, Kubrows, Syndicates, Maroo\\'s Bazaar, Focus... seems like similar destiny awaits recently introduced Lunaro)\\nGrind, oh god, grind increases exponentially with each new update. I feel really bad for newer players. Devs tell they want to change the situation where old-time players have tons of resources and nothing to spend them on. And how they fix it - they release a weapon with crafting requirement of 30000 for a not so common resource called Cryotic. To explain, you can get like 100 Cryotic in 2-3 minutes maximum if you\\'re good at only type of missions where you can get it - excavation. There you have to defend excavator for 2 min which can be simply one-shot by high level enemy (there\\'s enemy damage scaling issues too, yup). Not to say the weapon itself is again a useless one.\\nAfter community uproar passed and people seemingly forgot about this issue, devs release new Primed Warframe with requirements for similar kind of resource (Oxium) of 14000 (by similar I mean the way to obtain it - you have to play specific missions to get it and amount is like 10 per specific enemy at best, and there are not too many of those enemies).\\nAfter another community uproar it was changed to 7000, which is still a huge amount for many people, and more so for newer players.\\nAlso Void, a place where Primed (\"glorified\") versions of Warframes and weapons drop. There were already many Prime Warframes released, and some of them have already been \"vaulted\" (taken out of drop tables). The official reason for that is there isn\\'t too much space in Void mission for many Primed Warframes and weapons, and not to create dilution in drop tables some Primes were vaulted. But from dev-team\\'s actions you can guess the real reason is different. There are several mission types in the Void that have little to no Prime part rewards and devs keep adding useless resources to the drop tables where they simply were not present several updates ago, thus intentionally diluting Void mission rewards.\\nAlso devs tend to put most desirable Primed parts into most boring and long (20 min) missions in the Void. And the chance for this part is like 5% or so, and guess what? It\\'s 5% for one of 5 different parts, making it 1% (if you\\'re lucky) for the exact part you want.\\nI guess it\\'s okay that people don\\'t want to waste 2000 minutes of their time to have a chance to get the part they need. Not to go too much into details, I\\'d say Void missions are not the only missions that have this problem.\\nRecently there was an update addressing most of OP Warframe abilities, and that seems to be causing another community uproar now, as broken enemy mechanics are not fixed and most of the time those OP abilities were used to work around those broken enemy mechanics. I\\'m not sure how high level missions (Sorties) or raids (aka Trials) will look like after this update as in some cases there will be no counteraction to nearly instakill damage any more, especially when you barely scratch the enemy\\'s health (lvl 100+ enemies).\\nEndgame here is like it\\'s either you relying on those OP abilities to keep you alive or you get one-two shot the moment you fail to do so.\\nTL;DR\\n- Devs produce more and more content (and bugs and broken mechanics too) and seems like they forget of even 2-3 month old content\\n- Ever incresing grind, with latest updates - exponentially\\n- Warframe abilities nerfs without fixing core enemy problems that were causing players to rely on these \"OP\" abilities\\n- Many initial game design flaws that most likely never will be adressed',\n",

The vanilla version of the game is riddled with bugs, from falling through the world to your dinos just vanishing before your very eyes (sometimes meaning MANY hours lost for nothing). The head of Wildcard Studios took a big hit when he was sued for breaking a contract with his previous employers, im sure this is why they decided to go ahead and focus on making a paid dlc expansion, even though it was sooooo the wrong move. you dont sell someone an unfinished game, tell them youll finish it, but then make them pay you for more content before its even finished or EVEN SLIGHTLY POLISHED. this game is so poorly optimized you need one hell of a computer to even get 30 fps. on top of all these things, every single update they push out, and i do mean all of them, something gets pushed back most of the time indefinitely (DX12 anyone?). I would love to say all these hours ive spent in game have been worth every penny, but the truth is the frustrations of a broken game FAR out number the amount of good times had.\\nUPDATE: This company is a joke, they cant make deadlines and have done nothing but deliver short on their promises for a while now. the promised features of Fear Evolved 2 are a great example of their utter failure in communication with their player base. almost none of the features they promised were introduced and they didnt bother saying anything TIL THE UPDATE WAS ALREADY LIVE.',\n",

       " 'Early Access title, unfinished, bugged—fair enough, that\\'s what Early Access is all about; going along for the ride while the game develops, during it\\'s journey towards reaching \"Gold\" status, towards it being released.\\nThey have however decided to (imo.) abuse the Early Access flag, and arguably used funds received from players willing to put up with issues during the game\\'s development—funds they\\'ve received from consumers who wanted to support them and their idea for a game, from consumers who\\'s been willing to support them from an early stage in the development cycle—to instead focus their development on paid DLC, to attempt to take advantage of and \"milk\" said consumers, while the game is still unfinished and in the Early Access state. A pretty disgusting business move if you ask me.\\nI\\'d steer clear of this and other games by the same devs/publisher. Personally, I find this absolutely despicable. And if they can sink this low, I won\\'t even want to imagine what else they\\'d be willing to do in the future.\\n___\\nIt may be of interest to consider how this paid DLC comes out after Studio Wildcard recently had to settle a \"ugly\" lawsuit too (of which you can find articles through, e.g., Google if you\\'re interested in the vague information sorrounding it), that had been going on for months now. A lawsuit which allegedly started with a claim for $600 million, but that were (again, allegedly) settled at $40 million. Perhaps there\\'s some correlation there? You\\'ll have to make up your own mind about that I guess.\\nSome players state that the paid DLC was planned from the very beginning (which imo. is in its own right equally disgusting, regardless of how you look at it; \"Please fund us so we can develop a game idea, and paid DLC for it that we can charge you with later on, using said funds. Oh, we\\'ll also omit this little detail on our Early Access store front details.. oopsie!\"), and that it were supposed to release at the same time with the game going out of Early Access, which has been pushed back being that that game is not ready. If that\\'s the case, wouldn\\'t it have been a better idea to push back the paid DLC too? To avoid this distaste that people feel in regards to its release during Early Access?\\n___\\nNote: With my own account, I have only installed and fired up the game for the required 5 minutes needed to leave a Review here on Steam. I have however kept up with the development, on and off since December 2015, when visiting a friend to whom I gifted this game the same day I bought it myself. Basically, in my opinion, it hasn\\'t been ready for stepping out of its Early Access box, and I still feel that is the case as this is being written; which is also a large part contributing to why I never got enticed enough to install and play the game for myself. The idea of the game enticed me enough to want to support it early on, the current state of it however, put me off playing, repeatedly. With this paid DLC stunt, I\\'ve written it off as a regretful purchase, and one which Steam has declined my refund request on I might add (which is fair enough, as it was purchased in 2015; in other words, it\\'s well beyond 14 days of purchase).\\nAlso, to put it out there; I wouldn\\'t normally leave a Review like this, but I find it so absolutely despicable to put out paid DLC on a product which is basically considered unfinished—waving its Early Access flag proudly on its store front—that I felt I had to pipe in as well, on how I too feel this should be considered unacceptable business practices within the industry. And you\\'re obviously welcome to disagree with views on that subject. But at the same time, I would like for you to attempt doing one thing; and that is to try taking a step away from the fondness you may or may not have for the product, and to look at the situation presented in a bigger picture, one could even use the old expression; from \"outside the box\". Simply walking away, not voicing your distaste together with the masses that feels the same way, sets a precedent that this kind of business practice should be perfectly acceptable in the future. Not only for this game, but various other unrelated ones released under the Early Access flag as well. Is that a future you\\'d like to see come to fruition?\\nYes, critique on something you are fond of can be frustrating. Yes, a large quantity of negative, recent, user reviews may or may not have a negative effect on the future player base and sales of the game. But let\\'s be honest here, it doesn\\'t take a genius to see that this DLC stunt were going to rile up a portion of the consumer base. Especially with the Early Access title still lacking \"promised\" features, being behind schedule, having a myriad of bugs (which is fair for a E.A. title) and the studio involved in its development recently having to settle a legal lawsuit in the tens of millions (allegedly). These things combined are likely to create some confusion, and ultimately distaste.',\n",

       " \"I have played this game for two years, and have ambivalently enjoyed it.  There are many things it does really well -- the action and feel is great, when it's great.  And it's got personality, complete with your missiongiver (the Lotus) being creepily manipulative and codependent, and your ship's AI being hilariously Tourettesy and sullen.  The good parts have been good enough to overlook a lot of really irritating things.\\nBut, after years of playing this, I have to turn my thumbs down given the path it's been on for quite a long time.  The good has been shrinking rapidly in proportion to the bad, and, given that a game like this is one you play for the long haul, I can't recommend it to anyone starting out.  As time goes on, at least in the two years I've been playing, it has only become *more* buggy, *more* tedious and *less* rewarding, to the point where I wonder if the devs respect their playerbase.\\nProblems (short version):\\n1) The game has longstanding, serious game-ruining bugs that do not get addressed, while new content introduces new embarrassingly-bad bugs that should not have survived beta testing.  They just don't seem interested in fixing them.\\n2) The game is a grindfest, and that's part of the game and has been for a long time, and that's fine within reasonable bounds.  But the reward curve has been getting worse while the game has been getting more tedious and requiring more mind-numbing repetition of missions not interesting enough to sustain that repetition.\\n3) In their quest to extend game life and make more challenge, the devs have been creating artificial difficulty by, for example, creating missions that are long and tedious, and, rather than requiring skill, require patience as the players repeatedly engage in Skinner-box behaviors until the mission is finally complete. \\nPutting 2) and 3) together, the game is becoming a less- and less-rewarding Skinner box, and it's known as Trollframe to many players now because of its irritating non-rewards after extended, much-repeated tedious missions.\\nProblems (long version):\\n1) The devs seem to have become sloppier and sloppier.  Pretty much all new content is patched in with insufficient testing, and serious game-degrading/session-ruining bugs and frustrating glitches go uncorrected.  Most recent case has been the change of how enemies spawn in Extermination-type missions, in which you have to kill all enemies on the map to complete it.  Apparently, the devs found that some players had figured out how to complete these missions more quickly by stealthing them, making them able to grind faster.  Horrors!  So the devs immediately implemented a change that staggers them differently and makes some spawn well-behind the players -- sometimes at the mission start! -- making for a lot of time-consuming backtracking.  It also makes it so not all enemies are spawned by the time the players reach the final room of the mission, so the players just sit there from 3-10 minutes waiting for them to spawn in onesies and twosies.  It's disproportionately frustrating, like an extended, interactive loading screen that just sits there for a long time but requires your continued attention to progress.  This change has not been retracted 3 months after the fact, and it's not fixed.  Why not test it before putting it into production, or withdraw it until fixed, if it contains a serious bug?\\nThere are lots of things like this.  There are a lot of bugs that just don't get addressed, and some of them (like falling out of the map, which happens more frequently than it should) have no in-game remedy and are mission-ruiners.\\nOn the other hand, if there is a grinding shortcut, the devs are ON that, lickety-split.  So, instead of fixing the backspawning problem (making the player run all the way back to early parts of the mission to kill a newly-spawned mob, making the mission take a couple minutes longer with what amounts to a fetch quest) that has annoyed players for at *least* two years, they instead introduced *more* spawn delay and backspawn to thwart players that might be able to cleverly shave a minute or two off a mission (and, interestingly, completely avoid the backspawning bug).  From this, I can only infer that backspawning is intentional, and what bothers them is when players can *avoid* experiencing it.  Your priorities are showing, DE.  That one right there gets them a big middle finger from me.\\n2) The game has been increasingly oriented toward endless, frustrating grinding with worse and worse chances of getting desired item drops -- it's been getting worse, such that these days people commonly refer to it as Trollframe.  The game is grinding-oriented -- we all know this.  But the devs have increasingly been orienting the content such that it involves this sort of grinding: so-and-so mission will be available for 7 days, and you can only get X item from it.  You need to collect all its pieces from repeating a long, tedious mission, which has a random chance to drop them as its end-mission reward.  They've set up the drop tables (percentage chances of getting each item at the end) so you can get a couple of the items reasonably, but one of the items has a very low percentage chance to drop, so you pile up extras of the first parts while you get silly junk items the other half of the time.  So you repeat this mission twenty, thirty, forty times, til you're numb with it and despise it, but you're pressing that twenty-minute Skinner box button sequence hoping for the thing.  Grinding can be fun and engaging, but they've pushed the envelope too far.\\n3) In terms of actual gameplay, there's been an irritating trend toward more tedious and irritating missions and enemies.  The latest one at the time of this writing, the giant robot-dog Razorback, is a mission filled with bugs and made artificially long and tedious.  It's not difficult once you know how to do it, but it takes forever because of the way it is strucured (press this button, wait for bursa robot to jump down, knock him down and hack him, wait for him to disable Razorback's defenses, now shoot Razorback in a 2-second time window that isn't really very clear when it starts so you might miss it, and repeat 6 to 30 times depending on player DPS and other factors).\\nEh, I'm tired of the game looking more and more like a literal Skinner box -- that Razorback mission is almost humorously literal in being one.  Except we only have a small chance of getting our birdseed at the end, and I'm tired of doing it.\\nNope, can't recommend it.  Devs are reaching into more and more questionable game mechanics and feedback mechanisms to extend its life, and it's become a burnout-inducing tedium-fest.\",\n",

The background narrative, in fact, will give us an excuse to put ourselves in the shoes of ninja called to fight a futuristic alien faction. Home menu you can choose between different worlds to visit where we await missions to complete possibly in the company of three other players. Challenge between intergalactic ninja! The objectives vary enough, but the main flaw of the title Digital Extremes is out soon given the limited variety of levels. You will be prompted to save the hostages, locate a reactor to destroy or find an object, but whatever the delivery, in Warframe you'll almost always eliminate waves of enemies, chasing the various waypoint marked on the map. The gameplay, fortunately, fairly obvious problems of repetition of the title. With the view placed behind our Tenno (the name of the metal ninja who impersonate), we will have firearms and trusts katana. Come into play the Warframe champions representing the different possible configurations of the armor. These identify the different classes of ninja, with unique features useful to customize the game experience. Challenge between intergalactic ninja! Initially there are three, while the other can be purchased with real money or get through the crafting system included in the title. The Warframe not only change the appearance of your character, but activate specific skill such as enabling stealth attacks, rather than providing armor thicker than usual and so on. The user then accesses to further customizations to buy with credits earned in each mission completed successfully. These enhance the efficiency of its Warframe but not only. There are in fact many consumable items to carry around for the later missions, useful to address the weaknesses of its configuration and style of play.\",\n",
       " 'Warframe is an amazing game, but it\\'s not for everyone.\\nGame overview:\\nYou play as the Tenno, master of swordmanship and gunplay, and \"pilots\" of the Warframes. In other words, you are space ninjas with super powers. Your objective lore-wise is to regulate the universe\\'s warring factions and maintain a balance between the powers. It\\'s a very fast-paced third person action-RPG shooter that is primarily co-op PvE. Your squad can consist of one solo Tenno, or up to four total. You can equip your Tenno with a Warframe, Primary Weapon, Secondary Weapon, and Melee Weapon of your choice. Collect materials and blueprints to build more things to equip.\\nPros:\\n-EXTREMELY incredible engine, everything looks and runs amazing even on low-end systems and toned down settings. \\n-EXTREMELY customizeable Warframes/Weapons. You can build your Tenno any way you want, and try a million different things to explore what\\'s fun and strong! There are something like 250 different weapons, and most of them are completely unique to one another. You will definitely find something you like that fits your playstyle.\\n-Movement and combat flow incredibly well. You are a space ninja. You can do anything.\\n-Everything is obtainable through gameplay. All weapons and warframes can be obtained through play with some effort, and the premium currency (for cosmetics, or insta-buys) is tradeable ingame, so you can get things that people want and trade for premium currency!\\n-Very good community. They\\'re always more than willing to help newbs with any questions or missions. Just ask in region chat, you\\'ll get hooked up with just about anything you need.\\nCons:\\n-EXTREMELY grindy. You will be playing the same, or similar missions, A LOT. Over and over, just to get what you need to make that piece of equipment that you want. Having so many build options at your disposal can somewhat remedy this (allows you to play a different way, even if it\\'s the same mission), but for most people it\\'s still a pain.\\n-Crafting times are in realtime, somewhat similar a mobile game paywall. It takes 12 hours to craft most weapons, 24h for some. 12h for warframe parts, then three DAYS to combine them into a useable warframe. Obviously that\\'s annoying and it\\'s a turn-off for many. However, you can still actively play the game and collect materials, mods, complete missions, etc in the meantime so you\\'re not BARRED from play, just takes a while to use the shiny new thing you\\'re excited for. Or if you\\'re willing to pay, you can rush the build time with premium currency (Devs gotta make money too :P).\\n-The developers are always paying attention and active within the community... but honestly do a pretty poor job of delivering what the community wants. Many times when the community asks for a change for something that\\'s usually completely necessary or there\\'s no downsides to it, the developers still won\\'t make the change without adding some kind of catch. \"Yeah, we\\'ll do this for you, BUT...\"\\n-Lacks any kind of thorough tutorials. There\\'s a ton of things that are vague and very difficult to figure out by just playing the game. You may as well just ask in region chat or look things up on the wiki if you\\'re confused, because you\\'re unlikely to find the information you need by searching ingame.\\nSummary:\\nOverall, personally, I believe this game is definitely worth the time if you\\'re the type of person who doesn\\'t mind grinding. The gameplay is just so phenomenal that it outweighs all of the negatives. The community ALWAYS warmly welcomes new players, and will usually stop on a dime to help them out with whatever they need! Seriously! Watch some videos, play it for yourself. It\\'s free, may as well try it!\\nIf you decide to play and need help, you can message me ingame if I\\'m online! IGN: CuteNabi',\n",

I have been playing warframe for over 200 hours (i know that\\'s small) but i always learn new things everytime i play. there is alot of things to do once you reach the end game, once you finish the game, like fashion frame, sorties, and all that. so is Warframe a good game?

Just don't expect it to be any different after those first 5-10 hours.\\nSpeaking as a player from the Steam Release in 2013.\\nWasted potential: The Game\\nHorrible weapon and frame balancing.\\nDevs seem to outright refuse to fix fundemental issues with the game and are just content with piling more shiny things onto the garbage heap.\\nEndgame can be hit within the first 5-10 hours of play. It's just grind and scamming other players in trade-chat.\\nGame is incapable of being difficult without also being tedious at the same time (meat sponges; insta-gib-capable foes; forcing gear limitations; stat restrictions, etc.). In part due to the satisfying but ultimately imbalanced movement system and fundementally broken mod system.\\nMod system relegates player progression to the mercy of RNG's whims.\\nMod drop tables are over-saturated with useless things (like +7.5% radiation resistance) that absolutely nobody runs. If anybody tells you that they run those mods, they're simply horrible players or their mod count is lower than the number of combined digits across their fingers and toes.\\nStances; advertised as a long-awaited fix to the horrible melee system, were a disappointment and also relegated to the drop tables, futher saturating them.\\nNo variety in builds if you want to grind efficiently. Stack damage mods on guns; slip in crit mods if the base chance is 20% or more; put every power mod that would be suitable on your frame, then fill the rest with durability mods.\\nMelee has been awful forever and only serves as a mobility tool.\\nEnemies are either inconsequential glass figures or spicy meat-sponges due to the messed up scaling bought upon by the mod system.\\nDon't ever buy platinum (paid currency) unless you get a 50% off coupon or better as a daily login reward. It's horrible value for money otherwise.\\nFor the love of god do not buy the starter packs on Steam at their base price. They are a HUGE rip-off; only reason I bought the Tenno Pack last year is because it was like 75% off during winter sales and became excellent value-for-money.\\nWeapons and Warframes in the market are hideously overpriced considering you'll need to go through tens of weapons and warframes to rank-up.\\nPvP is an absolute joke. You know how in  most RPGs you deal a lot of damage compared to enemies, but also have a lot less HP compared to them? It's like turning party members in those games against each-other. You just run about instagibbing/getting instagibbed and finding ways to cheese the system.\\nEnemy variety is poor, with the only real distinctions being the differences between heavy troops and regular ones (the former of which is the only thing you should really consider when modding weapons as they're far, far more resilient than regular enemies).\\nThere's no pay2win, only pay2notgrind. Warframe utilizes a time-based gating system like those commonly found in mobile games. You kill enemies in missions, they'll drop materials. You'll buy the blueprint from the marketplace. And then you'll craft the item.\\nWeapons take a minimum of 12 hours to craft; clantech takes 24 hours PLUS the time spent crafting the pre-requiste materal (this can make the cumulative time of some clantech to be over 96 hours if you're dead-on with your timing in moving through each stage) Although there are many missions available which offer those special materials as rewards, massively reducing the total clantech crafting time. Warframes take a minimum of 84 hours to craft; get the helmet, system and chassis blueprints as random boss drops, they take 12 hours each but can be crafted simeltaneously, then combine them into the main warframe blueprint from the market, which takes 72 hours to craft.\\nTo be honest, I don't have an issue with the time-gating system as it isn't coupled with pay2win stuff like most time-gate systems are. Although some might, which is why I've explained it here.\\nThe good things about the game?\\nIt looks very nice. Although the atmosphere is non-existent as opposed to how it was years ago (go search for early-2013/late-2012 footge and compare it with 2014 footage).\\nMovement system is fun but is almost impossible to balance around without introducing tedium.\\nGunplay is okay I guess.\\nDevs don't do rollbacks whenever exploits pop up and are fixed. If you're fast, you can capitalize.\\nOnly real reason I'm still on-and-off with this game is, plainly put, some form of addiciton. Although I did quit cold-turkey for about 8 months earlier this year out of plain disgust with their implementation of the stances system. At the time of writing this, it seems I'm phasing out again. Whether or not I'll come back I don't know.\\nAlthough I'm looking at this from the perspective of a long-time player; so if you're new then you probably haven't become disillusioned with the game quite yet and will enjoy the bit that you play.\\nIt's like a worse version of Mass Effect 3's multiplayer.\\nAlso:\\nWarbros #1\",\n",
       " \"Great concept, rubbish implementation.\\nThe core ideas of Warframe are ace, get a load of powers and guns, smash weird enemies in varied environments, all the while getting stronger. Add onto this a solid movement system as well as an initially rewarding progression system and Warframe should have the strength of core gameplay to barrel right through minor flaws of balancing or uneven progression mechanics.\\nUnfortunately, Warframe doesn't have minor issues with progression, it's infested with them. While most of the epynomous Warframes are all if not balanced then at least varied, the vast majority of the game's massive arrray of weapons exist only to level so that you can progress the weird and clunky Mastery mechanic whereby you get to take a series of uninteresting tests to unlock some, but only a few of the more advanced weapons. The mechanic does provide some advantages to levelling new weapons, but only once you're long past the point of painfully grinding a progression of dull nondescript weapons instead of getting to play with whatever your favourite is.\\nCompounding the issue, newer stuff is almost always better, and rather than spending any effort on balance, the devs created a system of random powerups, the variance of which is so massive that it will make weapons either embarassingly overpowered or actually provide bonuses to stats that the weapon does not posess. It's a mess of a system, and only the most extreme signal that Digital Extremes haven't got the faintest idea what to do with their game.\\nRecommendation? Play it for a bit, it's free, and the core gameplay isn't bad, but be very aware that you're far better off waiting a long time before spending anything on the game's ridiculously overpriced RMT offerings. further, this is no Blizzard or Riot game, don't expect well thought out development in tndem with the ridiculously priced monthly RMT content packs.\",\n",

The best quality about Warframe is that, for better or worse, they actually bother to make the changes. That's more than what can be said for a lot of other games out there.\\nMy biggest complaint about Warframe has always been the grind. The grind is ridiculous, something like 40-50 hours of grinding for a single piece of gear, which can be bypassed by spending somewhere between 2 and 7 dollars. Sometimes this gear isnt even good and you end up feeling like♥♥♥♥♥♥for bothering with it.\\nI have a lot of time in this game, so I can bypass most of these grinds by virtue of having enough rare stuff in game to either trade for it or have already farmed the rare stuff required. However, new ways to grind keep getting added. I've been playing since the start of open beta some 3 years ago. I've seen countless ways to farm nerfed to the ground and disappear from the community's knowledge. I've seen rare material drop rates globally nerfed, not once, but two times. I've seen new things added with sub-1% chances to acquire it, mandating dozens, if not over a hundred runs of the same mission. I've seen exploits exploited, and completely unfair and unjust changes made in the span of 8 hours, damning anyone who couldn't log in in time to prepare. I've seen all the worst Warframe has to offer and it's been pretty damn bad sometimes with the decisions Digital Extremes have made. But they live up to that name.\\nFor all the full on disappointment I've felt for Warframe, there are also awesome moments. Moments where people really come together and just be players in a game, discovering all the cool combos, hidden places, or fancier ways to murder countless enemies, together. That feeling of being in a new world, ready to discover whatever's next. That feeling that I only get from great MMOs when they were in their prime.\\nThat's where Warframe is right now, a great game, in its prime, ready to capture the imaginations of any player willing to give it a chance. If I ever get angry at the game, disappointed because whatever system was made too grindy, or some item made too hard to acquire, or a nerf hitting too close to home, I feel that because I care. I care about what happens in Warframe. I want it to be the best it can be, the game that I was meant to play and enjoy for years.\\nIts still that game that got me hooked. However, I cant enjoy it like I used to. Is it because the game didn't change enough for me to keep liking it as much? Or did I change, and now my interests don't align with the fun to be had in Warframe? Was there more I could have done, but didn't do?\\nI hope that its just me.\\nTL;DR: It's okay.\",\n",

The same bosses are encountered time and time again. Eventually the mastery levels and syndicate standings become meaningless, and become more of a tedious grind to get to the next one, only to be rewarded by more slots for weapons and such, which by the time you get to mastery rank 10 or so and enjoy the game, you've probably dropped about $200 on a prime access pack or some platinum, which you'll probably buy slots anyways then.\\nThe market itself features items that are insanely overpriced, and although you can trade for platinum (paid currency) it's once again a chore to acquire such platinum.\\nIn other words, play it to enjoy it for the few hundred hours you get on it, get something nice for yourself in the market if you feel like it, however once you get there, you're pretty much done as the updates are way too far apart to take any real interest in the game to keep it fresh.

I mean DINOSAURS! \\nThis game is in early access and changes should be expected. And in the short time I have played it there have been many additions. From new creatures to the TEK technologies. \\nI believe that the TEK technologies are too difficult to obtain for a casual Tribe (This games name for clans) and that the attainmnet gap should be much lower.\\nAnother complaint is the seeming total disregard for PvE servers. In the latest patch Ca. 31/3/2017 they instigated a patch that has dramatically reduced the capabilites in both flight duration and speed of the flying dinosaurs. This move has by a vast majority of the player base been rejected as making core game mechanics such as farming and taming which are core for the PvE community both for freebuilding super bases or running large breeding projects. This total ignorance of your player bases wishes in my opinion makes this game house no better than the total trash EA produces. \\nAs far as construction goes the game has a fairly extensive set of contruction capabilities which allow the creation of large pens, breeding capabilities, farming capabilities, large scale manufacturing and refining processes. It is by no illusion a seamless contruction process with v. poor placing mechanics and upgrade options. An example is in a recent building which I recently upgraded to metal (This is now debilitatingly time consuming to do with the flyer nerf) in which I has a misplaced wall during first contruction because instead of an internal wall snapping to the closer foundation edge in line with the rest of the wall I had placed it snapped to the further one which offsets that one wass by about a half foot. This at the time did not cause an issue with the building however when I went to replace the ceiling of that building with metal. The metal ceilings should have been replacing the stone ones and consuming them in the process. This did not happen, and after investigation I discovered it is because a single snap issue has messed up 10+ of Aviary construction and replacement.\\nI cannot in this games current state recommend this game to anyone. On June 2nd this game will have been in steam early access for 2 years... That is longer than the life span of most AAA titles. Despite this the developers frequently use this early access as an excuse for the extensive bugs in the game. The game as it is now could be released if they instead of developing MORE bugged features for the games focussed on a release candidate. Then released content after that.',\n",
       " \"Let me start by saying I really love this game. It's a great sandbox with survival, crafting, and dinosaurs - what more could one want? I've had a lot of fun times with friends (we have a private server) and this game gives you a real sense of satisfaction for accomplishing some of the more difficult tasks. Up until update 256, I would have recommended it wholeheartedly.\\nThen they nerfed flying dinos.\\nNow, fliers are REALLY important in this game. There's enough nasty stuff roaming the land that if you can't fly, you have to take a squad of dinos to get anywhere safely and it can take hours to gather resources which would otherwise take maybe 30 minutes. There's a number of dinos which are much, much easier to tame if you can tranq them from a flying dino rather than on the ground. Crossing oceans is way faster with a flier than with a raft. (There's only one type of raft and it can't be upgraded for speed or carrying capacity.) \\nI get it that fliers unbalance pvp. I would have been fine with the 20% nerf they were talking about. But what we got was much closer to a 75% nerf (dinos with 3k stamina went to 800 stamina) and a very low hard cap on movement speed. Most fliers can barely carry a rider now, let alone any significant cargo. Quetzes, the great (and hard to obtain) utility airships of the game, are almost worthless. One of the main effects of this nerf is increasing the time it takes to do anything in game; where before one could hop on a quetz and fly to another island to mine some obsidian, now one has to take dinos down to a raft, sail the raft over to the island, make repeated trips with fliers which can carry very little weight to shuttle the harvested resources down to the raft, then sail it all the way back. For those of us who can't play the game 8-12 hours a day, this is a significant handicap to getting anything done.\\nI've heard people say that the flier nerf makes players use land dinos again. We've always used land dinos as well as our fliers, because fliers are useless at harvesting most resources. Fliers are first and foremost transport, for the player or his land dinos, and nerfing air transport is a huge hit for everyone, not just the pvp tribes. I think it would have made more sense to nerf fliers health to make them less useful in pvp, leaving them still able to act as utility dinos. Nerfing both speed and stamina renders them worthless for pretty much any task and reduces players to a land-based game, which makes me wonder why they didn't just take fliers out all together if they were going to nerf them this badly.\\nWe're going to find worshop mods to run on our private server to fix this issue (very thankful for the active modding community!) because we love this game and want to go on enjoying our time playing it, but I'm pretty upset with Studio WC for handicapping all their players like this just to deal with one set of issues. If the flier nerf is repealed I'll change my review to positive, but right now I can't really recommend the game to new players because of how badly this update has screwed gameplay up.\\nOnce I get my quetzes back I'm going horse hunting, because those things look awesome. Until then I don't have the time to laboriously chase them down on foot across the dino-filled jungles. Last time I went hunting with land dinos I ran into a wild giga and lost my whole pack. That was a lot of bred dinos down the drain. I really do like this game, but seriously, Studio WC - the flier nerf is just too extreme.\",\n",

I have still yet to play SE content, I'm still happy with The Island and The Center intrusions. So it tells just how much of time can be put into this game.\\n800h on solo/own dedi rest on a unofficial dedicated with luckily good community. With nearing 3k hours of gaming in a year... I've played more than I have worked. It is just that damned good game to sink time. Still after all this time of enjoyment I cannot recommend the game anymore. The devs have slapped their players in the face many times and I still did not like how they did their things, but their lack of communication as developers is nearing the end of my patience.\\nI just like the game, but I cannot endorse bying it anymore. I lack motivation to bring more players to this game and I brought plenty to begin with. For to not recommend a game after such a long time of playing is hypocrisy, but it is honest opinion to the way this game has been going. I keep playing it as it is good, just that good to come back.\\nBut recent changes to the game ignoring thousands of player inputs which are much more down to gameplay than developers are just awful to watch. There is edge where different sides of communities collide, but they say their opinions more or less in constructive way, but they are all stumped by the arrogance of the devs not knowing their own game and how to deal with it. Developers implement things and have to patch it up for months so it works as intended and without breaking the core game after the update.\\nThere is huge gap between developers and gamers, something that only shouting can fix up. I cannot understand why did they take this route... If they worked with the community even a tiny bit more their game would be the best of two worlds, the way developers want it to go and how gamers see it best implemented for their enjoyment.\\n*-*-*\\nThis game offers survival with dinosaurs and a really good gameplay even with the bugs still haunting it. If one is persistent enough one will learn what to avoid, sure a tedious thing to ask for someone without experience, but at the core the game is a balance between gathering, taming and surviving. You can tweak it the way you like it and to your own   amusement. That is how well thought out the game is supposed to be, each to their own vision of that perfect gameplay.\\nBut with the amount of absolutes in this game... one cannot dodge things or have counters to things that should have, so the survival part becomes quite a daily chore. Had the devs even thought about the special abilities given in the past few months they'd see how frustrating the game has become. But to know about them first hand is something that startless the beginners a seasoned player has more chances to survive a surprise and recover, but even for them when most dangerous things are not the towering monsters around them something is awry...\\nEvery MMORPG player knows how lethal a stun and inability to retaliate is, but this game is more unforviging than worst of those I've played or seen played by others. There seems to be only one timer the devs think of... 10s. That is how long you are still and doing nothing when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan. Given the strenghts and weaknesses of different dinosaurs that is death sentence to some while others shrug it as nothing. Being on foot in this game is not something you do with pleasure, but are forced to by mechanics that are supposed to make the game harder. But while it makes the game harder it takes larger portion of enjoyment out of equation. Having annoyance is one thing, I'd shrug it off, but I've been overwhelmed by the amount of, or lack of, thought in these mechanics which are unavoidable.\\nSo what I did to counter these annoyances? I took more time in the skies I loved even before. But for now i have been taken that ability away, to enjoy third of travel means... Sure I can fly, but I don't enjoy it. On the same time traveling by waterways is even more tedious and while it adds a challenge it boils down to same annoyance as walking above ground, 10s  stuns and inablity to retaliate... Sure it boils down to avoid anything you know is dangerous, but it is not survival, it is artificial difficulty. \\nTo make end game players mortal while they should have atleast a fighting chance is challenge which I'd accept. But this game is detoriating from that, going more and more to the route that everything you do is death if done wrong. With the experience ( and gear! ) this far I can shrug off most of these with clever mechanics and knowing how things work, but they are not survival tactics... they are cowardly ways to bypass developers intentions of making the world difficult, but if their difficult is artificial, we, the players, will answer that challenge with all we can muster. And at worst... we stop playing the way we enjoy and just ignore content created for us.\\n*-*-*\\nThat is the bottomline of this negative review. For each 'challenge' we get, the enjoyment of the game goes south. If a game is not enjoyably challenging, it is just Cat Mario Evolved ( or games alike ). Something I don't recommend for a price of this game and hours needed to pour into it to even begin to enjoying it. This game is grindfest even when you get accelerated servers with all sort of mods to alleviate the grinding. But after you have grinded 'enough' the content given to you is just bunch of screw you thrown at from a point of view that has never played the game as 'just another player'.\\nI most likely keep playing this game, but I'm just not up to recommend it anymore. From April 2016 to December 2016 I would had... but now I cannot even if I'd like the company of friends to gather around. And this game is still evolving forward, something I hope will see mistakes from the past and change them. Potential is enormous, but attraction is waning fast if the aforementioned communication does not connect.\",\n",

       " \"Warframe is a great game, but it has lots of issues. I only suggest you play this game if you can tolerate grinding and are extremely patient. This game is an instance based mmo that offers great action based combat, with a nice sample size of frames(characters) to choose from. I will warn you now to ONLY continue to play this game if you absolutely ADORE the combat like I did. There is literally nothing to do in endgame but to grind for gear you don't need to make platinum(premium currency) or trying out new weapons and frames. You will spend hours upon hours grinding pointlessly.\\nI will tell you now, the frames are definitely all unique and fun to play, since that will be your only fresh of breath air throughout the game, Although the weapons are pretty stale. Sure, there are a lot of weapons to choose from... but only a small sample size of them are even viable in high level content, like 60 minute+ survival missions. In order to be relevant in raids you have to have mods that are very expensive to aquire as they are limited time items that only other players have. You will spend a lot of time doing nothing, as every time you craft a new weapon, frame, or quest item, it takes 12-32 hours to make in REAL TIME. You can of course speed up the process with some platinum.\\nI am happy to tell you that yes, you CAN get everything in this game for free. Although it will take a LOT of time. There is no auction house in this game, so you are forced to trade 1v1 with other players, negotiating and advertising your items. Again, more of a time sink, and in a sense, more grind, as you have to sit there and spam the things you are selling into chat until someone shows interest in it. It has taken me upwards to 5 hours to sell even highly sought after items, so be warned. \\nPVP in this game is laughable at best. You start off with no mods for your frame and have to participate in the PVP to get a chance at a good mod dropping that you can actually use. You can also buy the mods with platinum that you make from PVE content, which is probably the better route. So for those that like PVP be warned, you will have to endure getting smashed on by players who have invested more time in it than you to eventually be relevent. Even when you finally do get the mods you need to play PVP enjoyably, you will probably be highly disappointed at the fact that the incredible combat in the PVE portion of this game is not even taken advantage of in PVP. Every player you come across will literally ninja flip constantly and snipe you with high single target guns. \\nIf you can tolerate massive grind and the combat of this mmo is enough to drive you to play it, then by all means give it a shot.\",\n",

Visually, its absolutely amazing, and the art style is very distinct, with very identified personality between the factions. The combat may be glitchy at times, but it flows and shows a degree of freedom seldomly seen in other games. Movement is also very in-depth, wall runs, slide-jumps, and they can all chain together so that you dont just run anymore, you run, slide, jump, land, slide, attack slide, wall boost, land with an almighty smash of your melee weapon. By this time you commit these moves to muslce memory, your left pinky would be substiantially strong than your right one, so if you were plan to thumbwars with your pinky, i'd highly recommend this game.\\nGame play currently is very diverse, with several game modes: assisination or sabotage missions for those who enjoy Hitman; survival or defence missions for those who have nothing better to think about than SHOOT THOSE DUDES for 30 minutes+; boss fights for your inevitable grind for blueprints. Not to mention all the weapons and warframe you have, once you get to the 400hr+ mark, you'd have more suits and accessories than a spoiled-rotten 16 year old with her own creditcard.\\nThe bad- unfortunately, being any hardcore tenno require a lot of GRIND, as every weapon, warframe, needs to be grinded to level 30, and then repeat if you wish to forma(make it better). Not to mention all the grinding for material needed to craft the weapons and these awesome suits. Of course, it being a MMO, grinding is tolerated, and since I have 600 hrs in this game, certainly entertaining enough. \\nThe really bad- MONEY. credits and orokin cells are easy enough to grind for, but to get to the real end game(OWN EVERYTHANG), you need PLATINUM. certainly, you can now sell blueprints and mods, but that's very inefficient way to get plat.

So if you don't have a machine made in the last year or two prepare to invest  a minimum of $800 to play the game at at least medium graphics level.\\nSo if you're still reading this, my suggestion is to wait til the next summer sale and pick it up at a discount (and hopefully in a more stable state), the game was mostly worth it at $15 so if you can pick it up at $20 or less its something to consider, at $60-100, no, definatly not.\\nAt this point in time I do not recomend this game and you should stay away until it comes up for a deep discount (66% or more off)\\n-------\\nEarly Access Review\\nBefore I would say this is a great game, still is in a lot of respects, but putting out paid DLC on an early access game, diverting resources from key parts of the game that have been promised for months.\\nAll I can say is stay away until this is fully released, if it ever is, so you know what you're getting into.\\nARK was awesome a while ago but after the past few months it's been really stuttering and now this DLC fiasco is starting to have the makings of a money trap, with pay to play money walls.\\nSo Stay Away\",\n",

The developers put in a ability to transfer your character and poessions to another official server. Meaning if you want to go to a different server and bring some dinos, gear, and character level. you can, through on a in-game location called the \"obelisk\". What happened then was chaos and disaster and most likely be the very downfall of the game. When this came through, certain groups of people gathered all their stuff and went server to server to server to server WIPING EVERYTHING. These groups became so powerful on certain servers where people could not challenge them (slow progression made this a problem) they came into other servers and wiped everybody, meaning no bases or dinos or anything. These certain groups retain their power on the original servers but every so often wipe other servers and solidfying that no one will be as big as these groups want them to be. So you can work hard for as long as you like but its ether you get too big and lose everything so you have to stay under a certain limit BECAUSE of players or simply the timer ran out and its time for these people to wipe the servers. \\nYou might be thinking wow that sounds like hell there no way that is going on, the developers must of done something or are doing something to fix it. No its exactly whats going on because you can join almost any official server and see for yourself or even ask anybody in there and you will know everybody is just sorta just waiting to be wiped. The developers have done nothing, they wont even acknowledge it as a problem, in fact they dont want to acknowledge any of the problems with the game. There has been some rumors as well they actually want these problems to occur because if you look at the server list, there are so many official server with very few people on them. People are thinking the developers want this because they want people to quit and shutdown servers to cut cost (with how many hours it takes to get establish and lose it all most people quit the game in general). Even then they let there servers be disconnected that have been down for weeks and they have done nothing to bring them back and instead push forth Paid DLC? this early into the game development? \\nA kind friend bought me the game and its DLC because he wanted me to play with him and others. The DLC itself is a joke as well, the dragons (WHICH ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE DLC) can be brought from the DLC map and into the regular ark maps where some people can not have dragons because they dont own the DLC........Dragons are obviously superior dinos for their combat ability and all the advantages it brings (the certain groups of people i mentioned before ofc bring these dragons to other servers to wipe them). The map is also more difficult to start on and is harder to progress and by now anyone reading this, every server has a group of very well established people and wipes anyone they feel like and no one can do a thing about it no matter how hard or how long you try. The game itself never wipes but with certain groups coming in wiping everything or people who are already well establish will bring you down because they can and you will NEVER be able to retaliate.\\nI leave this game in complete dissapointment, this game could have been and stayed at being one of the biggest games played but more and more people are quitting because you can lose your many hours of work with some people having thousands, gone in couple hours with no way of finding a shortcut to bring that back.

Every patch that they released seemingly made the game worse, at least in my opinion. Patch after patch would only affect the largest tribes, completely ignoring the balancing issues faced by players who wanted to start their own tribes, or just play casually. I don't believe in my entire time of playing that I ever saw any significant bugs, abusive gameplay, or glitches fixed really. I was just expected to accept each patch because it would come with a handful of new dinosaurs that I couldn't have cared less about.\\n- Literally no concern for balance regarding small tribes or casual players. Servers set up and enforce their own rules. They even go as far as to completely block off areas which allow players to leave the server with their characters, which can ultimately destroy hundreds, if not thousands of hours of work for a player. The developers will do nothing for you on this either. I attempted to contact them serveral times myself, and either got no answer, or a generic one which ignored my problem followed by no response.\\n- Horrible optimization. I have a relatively good PC, and I was lucky to pull 30 FPS most of the time.\\n- Random and frequent server disruptions leading to dinos which take several hours, or even days, to tame failing,\\n- Server wars, in which a tribe which had a monopoly on another server would build up a massive force, and then bring over all of their dinosaurs and resources to a new server, completely destroying the tribes there if they were too weak, and setting up another monopoly there if possible.\\n- The game has a prisoner system in which you can knock another player unconcious, and then handcuff them and keep them in a cage. They cannot fight, run, or even die without interaction from another player. Their only hope is to spam global chat and hope that someone powerful enough to fight the captor might care enough to come and rescure them.\\nI'm probably missing a lot of cons as well, but honestly I think that whatever good you might have to say about this game, it's overwhelming outweighed by the amount of garbage you have to put up with in this game. I really don't advise putting your time into this game, tempting as it might be, unless it is on some sort of private server.\\n(Edit)\\nDisclaimer: This is only my experience and opinion on the game. I had a lot of fun with it in the beginning, but that quickly started to sour for the reasons posted above. I had several friends that played the game that quit before I did, and several that stayed long after, eventually becoming the server alphas. None of them ended up staying ultimately, and all of them have said they have no intent of going back any time soon.\\nIf you can stomach PVE, have hundreds and hundreds of hours to invest, or want to play on a private server or something, this may still be the game for you. In its current state, it just isn't for me, and the developers have shown no signs of improving it to that end, which is fine. This is their game, and they may have a large audience of players who disagree with me. This is just my opinion and warning to like-minded individuals.\",\n",

All that time went in alpha and beta and I expected there to be issues. I had a lot of funny and nice moments ofc. Everything is made for pure enjoyment. There is also good modding community.\\nSo why can't I recomment this game? I have a lot of reasons, after all this time this game even now, when it costs 60 euros and is released, is not fully optimised. Even on high end computer fps is crap. Graphics are great, but either wait things to load or play at low settings. Community, it is sometimes pretty toxic. There are soem alpha tribes moving from server to another and jsut ruining the game experience. And one more reason, the developers, they seem to not give a damn about the players. \\nThis review is for the people wanting or thinking to buy the game now. You might be disappointed if you buy this now. It is not fully optimised. I got it for about 20 euros back in the days, at that time it might have been woth the money. Of course if you do not care that much, go ahead and try it. It was good at times, that is why I can give it that good grade. \\nGrade for this game 7/10\",\n",
       " \"2500+ hours. Ran one of the top 10 servers in the world for Population. This is post is purely for feedback to the devs and those who wish to purchase the game.\\nPros: \\n* Dinosaurs\\n* Fun survival aspects\\n* Several tiers of tech\\n* Nice scenery if you can afford a 4000$ gaming PC\\nCons:\\n* 1) Constant bugs since release\\n* 2) Constant crashes in almost every aspect of gameplay (PVP is almost completely useless due to the crashing). Devs refuse to aknowledge or fix any of these bugs.\\n* 3) Mass forum bans from the moderators. No matter how innocent the post. the moderators will ban you over and over again (was once banned for politely asking another player not to plagiarize my server ad he stole word for word lol... Thanks for that moderators). The majority of the people posting on steam are banned for any and all reasons.\\n* 4) Worst ETAs i've ever seen. Patches are pushed back and back and back. Patches due to release on specific days are pushed back 14-20 times causing mass confusion and problems for server admins. People always argue that ETA are ETA. But the way to do ETA properly is to Figure out what you want to release in the patch, test it out, Then once it's ready and finalized give an ETA (will release patch at this time. And BE ON TIME!!!). the community, especially the admins will love you for it. I'd rather wait a day or two and have it release on time so i can update my server on time instead of staying up till 7 am in the morning to make sure my players can play.\\n* 5) Patches are NOT tested at all before release. Causing mass Wipes and critical bugs(swamp biome anyone? Invisible buildings anyone? lol).\\n* 6) Mass Hacking. No Anti Cheat what so ever.( yes it's coming. But it remains to be seen if it will actually work) Devs make a lot of false promises.\\n* 7) False promises. Devs promise one thing and never deliver. (1 of many examples; DirectX12)\\n* 8) Updates are almost always new dinos. there are 50+ dinos now. Most of them utterly useless. while it's great to have diversity, the map is overflooded with useless dinos. Make a bigger map of thin it out. No new tech, no diverse new gear(1 best gear for pvp, 1 best gear for cold..), no new game play. You can play the game for a week and get bored because of the lack of content.\\n* 9) Too easy to greif in the game. PVP has not been thought of very well. This gives admins a hell of a hard time upholding their rules.\\n* 10) Guns are Underpowered and unbalanced. A sniper does less damage then a pistol lol.\\n* 11) Major rendering issues. Have a base more then 6 tiles? Youll come within render distance and see EVERYTHING inside!\\n* 12) Dinos constantly disappear and vanish without a trace. Dino pathing is ridiculous! Needs a Major overhaul.\\n* 13) Developers RIP off mods, give the item a new name and claim credit for it(industrial forge? Industrial cooking pot?).\\n* 14)Developers are more obsessed on Hacking infested contests (survival of the fittest) and blowing away money to cheaters instead of focusing on the game.(this really pisses me off).\\n* 15)Coding needs alot of work server wise (people cannot find server on servers list, mod downloading issues etc).\\n* 16)Almost every single Admin command is corrupted and will glitch your game (force joining tribes, kill all wild dinos = crash etc).\\n* 17) Community is constantly ignored and treated like ♥♥♥♥ by the admins. Especially One Dev that starts with the letter N. I won't name him to not break any rules.\\n* 18) 2500$ gaming pc and Can't even run on full settings. Game is very poorly optimised.\\n* 19) It takes 30+ hours of non stop feeding to tame high level dinos and breed high levels dinos(officials). \\n* 20) Devs Repeatedly Add unbalanced dinos which ruin the entire game ( Godmode GIGAS that can destroy entire bases and 50+ dinos in 2-3 bites? WOW!)\\n* 21) Devs try to balance dinos by making them weaker then a ♥♥♥♥ing dodo bird?. Seriously? Absolutely no pre testing at all. Just another attempt at forcing players to grind for hours with Really weak dinos. this is not acceptable. Everyone has jobs, everyone has♥♥♥♥♥♥to do. Nobody can spend 10 hours grinding for 1 dino. That's not realistic. You're losing alot of good players because of this ideology. Grinding for hours doesn't mean skill.\\n* 22) Takes hours and hours and hours of hard grinding just to build a small base on official servers.\\n* 23) Several tiers of Tech is a good idea, but it was badly designed. Most people i know go from wood or stone to Metal because there is no point in the other tiers (waste of time).\\n* 24) Lack of community support regarding bugs. I've personally put in over 30 threads regarding issues which were all ignored by the dev team. Put a list of bugs you are currently aware of on a STICKY thread that way we know which to report and which not to.\\n* 25) build your base on a beach? Which 80% of the people do. Fresh spawns will almost always spawn inside your base.\\n* 26) Dinos falling through the world\\n* 27) Supply drops spawning above caves, or inside mountains.\\n* 28) Outdated supply drops for over 7 months. Supply drops are a big part of the game.\\n* 29) It takes on average 45-50 minutes to load the server list in the game's main page. How is anyone supposed to find a good/populated server when it takes that long to load?\\nTo Conclude. Ark is dying. It doesn't even have close to the same amount of POP we had 4-5 months ago. For example; only 3 out of the 200 people on my friendslist who used to play no longer play ARK. the most common reasons are 1) They cannot play due to the  bad optimization of the game 2) It's boring 3) Tired people greifing their hundred hours of grinding and hard work. In my personal opinion, everyone has moved on including the Devs. Devs have all but given up on the game now that they have raked in millions. The updates are slower and keep getting pushed back months after months after months. Promises made 5-6 months ago are pushed back till late August. Devs have made poor decisions regarding the way the game should have been built. Survival of the fittest? Great! Add that as a DLC or Free content after you've finished the core game. Instead of wasting weeks of development time on Dumb tournaments full of cheaters and corrupt players (Most of you know what i'm talking about). Further more, i appreciate that the devs release Q&A to the public. That's really good on your part. It's a step in the right direction. However,  i'm appalled at the moderators for mass banning people on forums, reddit forum etc. Calm down and Stop with the power trip. The community is here to voice their concerns. You can't og off banning people for no reason. Half the threads on steam are locked or banned because the devs don't want us talking about main issues (even those posting innocent comments get banned from people who abuse the report button a.k.a Spectre_06 Ertosi). The developers have made it very clear they do not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their community leaders. While ark is a fun game to play, it has too many problems and too many obstacles to overcome. The way that the population has been declining has proved this.\",\n",

The game gradually gets more boring if you're always put on a map to shoot someone all the time. Many of the maps are reused on different nodes and even different planets. To get the stuff you want you have to farm alot, possibly for a few days to get the stuff you want. Then you're forced to make it in the foundry. The foundry mechanic is very stupid as well. You have to wait to build weapons and warframes. If I am correct, it takes three days to build any warframe. So you probably spent about four to five days farming and then you have to wait another three days for a warframe. Minus a day or two if you're getting a weapon. I didn't come to play a game that makes you wait for stuff. The game also penalizes you if you don't play. Basically you can have pets and if you don't stabilize their DNA, they die. The thing is though, that this happens even if you're not playing. So I stop playing this game for a month and I see a new update. So I thought maybe there is something interesting (there isn't, it's worse now actually) and I see my in my inbox, there is a message saying my pet is dead.

There are frequent changes and updates being made to the game, being that this game is Free To play, the only reasons people wouldn\\'t download and play it for themselves is \"game memory size\" and/or download bandwidth limitations \\n.\\nFull disclosure, I\\'ve barely scratched the surface of the game (Yes, at the time I\\'m writing this review, I\\'ve only played for 20 minutes... and that\\'s barely scratching the surface!), but I\\'ve been getting caught up in other review projects and other games, so I don\\'t know how long it\\'ll take until I return to Warframe to continue my progress. That detail will either qualify or disqualify my review in many people\\'s eyes, so I want to be open and upfront with it right now.\\nYou are Tenno. The story starts out Tenno being awakened from Cryostasis by a mysterious figure known as \"Lotus\", you fight back the wave of enemies and secure a ship called the Orbiter where there\\'s a slightly unstable AI known as Ordis. Get used too these two voices because you\\'re going to hear them A LOT! From being on my ship and Ordis constantly asking whom I plan to kill and destroy next, to Lotus always scolding me whenever I get caught or an alarm has been raised on a mission. She could pretty much say \"So I guess you aren\\'t as good at stealth as you thought you were, huh Atratzu\".\\nThere are many different \"Warframes\", but they\\'re all connected to the same \"Tenno\". Each warframe looks slightly different, is highly customizable, Warframes have different powers, and some warframes appear male or female. Which inspired me to google \"Is Tenno Male or female\" and veteran players on forums seem to hate being asked that question so hopefully I\\'ve prevented some heated exchanges without butchering the explanation too much. Again: there really isn\\'t a gender for the Tenno, just different looking Warframes.\\nAs you go through the game there are a number of story progression and developments. You need to restore your ship, build crafting stations, active other stations. And then brace yourself for a huge time sink because after you unlock crafting you\\'re in for the farming spree of your life \\n. The game can be completely Free To Play and farm and grind your way to earn whatever you want to get. \\n Or you can use Platinum to speed up cool downs, or purchase upgrades or other Warframes. \\nAs far as the story is concerned, there\\'s a great deal of information and lore in the game, you can dig up even more by checking out codex entree\\'s on your ship on the various NPC\\'s, warframes, and much more. I\\'ve always found that the longer you work on a story the more satisfaction you get out of it.\\nThe controls for Warframe are quite straightforward, \"easy to learn, hard to master\", as people like to say about games like these. You can jump, double jump, sprint, roll, crouch, melee, shoot, change weapon, and use special abilities. There are also combo techniques for example, I frequently find myself sliding because I crouch and sprint all the time, so I often times find myself skidding on the ground off a ledge, and double jumping just in time to avoid falling off a ledge.\\nYou have many different weapon times, I found myself wielding a bow and Bo... HA, just realized I double Bo\\'d. But I also used Spira (kunai / throwing knives) side arms, and my most recently crafted weapon was the Grakata (machine gun). I typically try to play stealthy throughout a mission; thus my choice of weapons. But some missions you really can\\'t be stealthy on, and for those missions I wanted something with a higher rate of fire.\\nWarframe starts out very easily, so easy I completed missions without ever being detected. \\n However, the game gets complicated after you get closer to level 20-30 area\\'s the game starts to pick up in difficulty and I could no longer easily sneak through the game pinning my foes against the wall with my epic green arrows. The advent of moving out of \"early level / total noob status\", it became quite clear I had/have absolutely no idea what\\'s going on, and it\\'s going to take a great deal of research, reading, and explaining from friends who have played a lot of warframe, before I\\'m any good at it.\\nTake that as you will, the best suggestion I have is to watch some tutorial videos, or read up on some guides, there\\'s a lot that goes into this game and and the stats, gear, weapons, strategies, and tricks people use to get through the game. Sometimes the best strategy is to sneak through a level and pick people off with headshots, other-times you\\'re better off grabbing a noisy weapon, and gunning down a specific target you\\'re tasked to take down.\\nThere are many ways you can gauge your progression throughout Warframe. Your warframe and weapons have levels and upgrades that you can use on them. You also have \"Mastery Ranks\", and probably much more that I haven\\'t discovered yet. You can also take care of a pet, but you need to play actively to be able to get the resources to take care of your pet. Sadly I had to put my pet into stasis because I don\\'t play enough regularly.\\nI feel like I\\'ve only scratched the surface in this review, and I\\'ve already written a lot about game mechanics, the story, and controls. Ultimately the thing to take away from this review is \"Are you interested in this game? Has anything I mentioned in this review piqued your interest? If yes, download it and try it out for yourself, you\\'ve got almost nothing to lose.\"\\nI will add that I streamed some of the gameplay on my twitch channel and the warframe players I met over stream were quite friendly and didn\\'t insult me for not knowing anything about the game... and that\\'s pretty cool! Hopefully the majority of the community is like that, because that makes learning the game easier and less stressful.\\nIf I\\'ve missed anything really important in this review, or got something terribly wrong, feel free to comment with a correction!

       " \"Here are the good things about this game when you play Warframe.\\n1. You can become an ninja. In the game, you can literally be a ninja that can do sorts of things like fly in space which is known as an Archwing if you haven't known yet.\\n2. You can literally parkour. Just like Assassin's Creed, Warframe has recently added a new parkour system that can allow you to parkour through walls but not as that intense as Assassin's Creed.\\n3. You can have companions. - Seriously what kind of ninjas own pets. It's so cool that companions even have their own weapons and you can mod them to make them as powerful as your character or warframe. The only bad thing is that if you own a Kubrow they don't have weapons. Too sad for Kubrow owners. R.I.P.\\n4. The most awesome thing you can have is a freaking katana. The katana is called the Dragon Nikana and it's the ultimate weapon for a true ninja. The bad thing is you have to be at least Mastery Rank 8 to unlock it, get the blueprint, and use it. \\nSo far, this is all I can say about this awesome game called Warframe that can make you play as a ninja.\",\n",

If you do eventually find one then the next step is to grind away and build and collect untillyou can make yourself a little base to work off and maybe get a few dinos until someone comes along and destroys everything. Not because you were a threat, or because you had something they needed or because you attacked them, they destroy everything you have just because they can. one day you will log on and it will all be gone. so you start again, and again, and again, and again and eventually get tired of spending your life grinding and collecting and taming to only have it all destroyed and killed. Look just spend 5 Hours taming a dino. oh look they just killed it because they can. And their justification. If you dont like PvP play PvE and then deal with the fact that every server has bases taking up almost every inch of the map.\\nThen we start of the optimization issues.

       " \"I wanna get a few things off my chest in this review of Warframe, as someone who has been playing for over 550 hours, for those who are new to the game so they don't goof up as much as I did. First off, the game WILL take up space on your computer, so this isn't for the weak ones that crash easily either, and will also take up a portion of your time if you decide to play this.\\nSecond: this game is not something you can play for 8+ hours straight a day. Unless you have a clear objective of what it is you're gonna do when playing, be it alert missions that crop up with your desired rewards, missions, farming resources and prime items, etc. then you WILL get bored easily. I say this because of the hours I've wasted in indecision of what it is I wanted to do, and its just easier when you plan out what you want to work on.\\nThird: Be prepared to grind the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the missions when collecting resources or trying to rank up. You will not get far simply blitzing through each mission, and searching areas for much needed loot will help you later. Do not listen to those complaining about not getting enough loot when they go grinding, they make the mistake of speedrunning instead of being meticulous. That said, this leads me to my next point.\\nFourth: this IS a genuine F2P, and although real currency CAN (not WILL) be used, it is not necessary to advance at all. Using platinum (this is the currency you do exchange your real money into) is completely optional, and there are multiple tips I'll give on the use of it for newcomers: \\n1. Spending platinum is optional\\n2. don't use it on frivolous things like credits (the game's other currency that you can earn in any mission) or resources as it is NOT WORTH IT IN VALUE\\n3. save it for big purchases like colours, hard-to-obtain warframes or accessories. Trust me, you'll want to be stingy\\n4. There are ways of gaining plat WITHOUT spending real money, but it does involve grinding specific items and finding willing trading partners. These items are called 'Prime' items, and hold onto as many as possible - you do not want to be selling them for credits even if you cannot use them. Trade them as 'prime junk' with other items to gain platinum, just be patient when looking for partners. \\nFinally, Each warframe has a set of abilities connected to them that you can use. buttons 1-4 on your keyboard activate them during missions. It took me ages to realise they were even there, so I figured its best to tell you upfront to avoid my ignorance happening to you.\\nIts entirely up to you on how you play this, and yes there will be tech issues as addressed by other players, but otherwise its a fun way to spend a few hours of your day as well as be a paradise for hoarding and collecting. Or hell for the recovering ones, anyway. In short, good luck grinding the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game.\",\n",

The updates never bring ANYTHING new or significant.\\n-The lack of variety in gamemodes, there\\'s like 4 or 5 gamemodes and you better like them cause they are gonna be the only thing you play, ever.\\n-The PvP, this should have never been added, the Conclave is straight up dead, being horribly unbalanced and incredibly laggy, (I\\'ll get to the reason behind that next.) and Dark Sectors are controlled by clans that use DDoS and other shady tactics to force massive taxes down players throats.\\n-The lack of servers, every game is hosted by a player, which means lag, a LOT of lag, it sometimes makes the game literally unplayable, and it\\'s incredibly common.\\n-The crashing, I crash 2-3 times a day on Warframe, just... my god, if I had to list the amount of times I had to Alt-F4 out of the game, this review would be three times as long.\\n-The movement, you simply latch on to walls when you wall run, nothing feels natural, every jump, every vault, they all feel stilted and slow. Not to mention sometimes you just FLY mach 5 across the map when you jump from a sliding position, the jumps are so irregular.\\n-The melee combat, you run up to the enemy mash the E key and you MIGHT hit them, it\\'s completely random. And just like other weapons, melee weapons are completely unbalanced, for the most part heavy weapons are useless, and certain weapons destroy the rest hands down, its borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\\n-The Argon issue, every new weapon requires Argon crystals as an artificial way to make them harder to obtain, this simply comes from DEs issue of being uncreative with ways to acquire new weaponry.\\n-The fact that certain frames are one trick ponies, certain frames are only used for one (sometimes two) abilities, while the rest of their entire arsenal is completely ignored.\\n-The lack of a challenge, this somewhat correspondes with the game being too easy, with a certain frame and weapon, anything can be completed by a braindead child, people actually have to make up their own end-game of getting to high waves simply to have the RISK of being defeated.\\n-The lack of a skill requirement, as I said directly above, so long as you have the right weapon and frame, you can conqeur literally anything. There is no reward for being good at the game, in fact you don\\'t even have to try your best, simply having the numbers 1-2-3-4 on your keyboard is enough to be just as good as anyone else.\\n-The most ignorant developers I\\'ve ever seen, here is an example, there is a weapon called the Dark Dagger, it is awful, as every single handed dagger is. However, the hilarity insues when you realise, that the tiny Dark Dagger, is around the same speed as the giant two handed hammer Fragor. And you think that\\'s bad? NONE of the dagger stances actually match the Dark Daggers stance polarity, NONE. That is the most idiotic thing I\\'ve ever heard in my life to be honest.\\nIf you want to play with other people, join a clan, most of the community is elitism♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who don\\'t care about the gameplay, and are simply waiting for the next prime to come out.\\nThe more people who dislike this only proves what I\\'m talking about with the asskissing, every one of these points is true, no matter how much people will try to deny them.\\nFanboys will be ignored and most likely have their rant deleted, think before you post.',\n",

It can easily be said that it's dug into my subconscious and sucked me into the community and news more than any other game in my library, but just what makes it do so?\\nThe most mixed bag I've ever encountered. There are people that rip you off in trading, and leave one-wave survival fissures (I hate every single one of you, and so does anyone not you), but there's also people that start platinum (the game's big currency) charities for new players and actively try to make the community a better place. I have so many stories of both ends of the spectrum, but amazingly I've found that the good people in Warframe are unabashedly wonderful and outweigh the scum. From when I was an MR 1 noob to an MR 10~ still noob, there has always been a friendly face in a Relay or an encouraging word in Region chat to help. I've been carried so hard by friends old and new, and learned nearly everything through word of mouth, but I've never had a game bring that experience to me before.\\nAlso meme factor is unbelievable, I'd say the amount of goofing off through videos or inside jokes is on par with TF2 and I wouldn't even question it. If you like to goof off, both DE and the community will always have your back.\\nThe part everyone cares about. It can get grindy, it can get bs, it can get vague and unclear sometimes. All of these issues I've found to be remedied by getting/making friends to assist. Currently half the game is high-flying and fast-paced shootouts/brawls, and the other half is collecting/organizing mods and loadouts for either efficiency or humor factor. Any frame'r worth their salt will say the true endgame is Fashionframe, but I guess you could call helping new players and working the plat market to your favor the true endgames. DE still needs to figure out what balance is, but they're too loveable to stay mad at for long.\\nI am gonna say here and now that it takes a lot of work to impress me, and even more for me to genuinely like you. These complete nutcases and lunatics should not be left unattended or be allowed to run an MMO, but oh my good god have they won a spot in my heart for doing it anyways. Never seen a dev team so passionate, so hard-working, and full of so much character and personality as these loons. I love DE, even when they frustrate me and add universal vaccuum without telling me. These guys go with the flow, and embrace the juxtaposition of their game while simultaneously creating detailed and intriguing works of storytelling art, I do wish they didn't bury it in the later half of the game though. If you can get through the initial grind and fall into the rythm it demands of you, you will be rewarded with lore that will keep you up at night and asking questions.\\nIn summary, Warframe confuses me and we have a love-hate relationship but it'll never be uninstalled on any PC of mine.\",\n",

From the old Void and reward table system to this new relic one, I see a MASSIVE improvement in rewards and less reliability in off-site resources to be able to get what you're looking for. Not to mention improvements to trading and communication... Warframe really has tackled many of its issues and the developers don't seem to be afraid to rethink things and go outside the box. \\nGranted, I've only just recently gotten back into it, I'm still very impressed with how far it's come and how much has been added. I almost felt like a new player again upon my return, that's how much was changed yet all of the new additions were intuitive and by the end of it, I felt better about where the game is now compared to where it was when I stopped playing.\\nFor a game that's FREE and not pay-to-win, you really cannot go wrong.

Not only has its wide variety of missions, customization, endless weapon arsenal and increasingly-large warframe list, but also a fascinating lore that keeps growing. The coop element is crucial: nothing beats the experience of a full team of 4 space ninjas, each with their unique powers and weapons, wreaking havoc among hordes of unlucky enemies.\\nIt\\'s very easy to get started with Warframe, but it takes a lot of time and dedication to master all of it. Most of that dedication translates into farming. Farming of exp points, resources, credits, mods, blueprints, etc. Everytime you finally manage to craft that new weapon or warframe is so satisfying,... that\\'s when you get appreciate even the tedious part of the game. And even then, the game\\'s variety makes up for it. In my case, I have been playing it for 8 months straight, but I can see myself spending at least three times that amount of time in the future. That\\'s how hooked I got.\\nIn addition, after all this time, the game has accumulated a lot of story and lore elements that make it even more enjoyable to dive into. The introduction of the cinematic quests, starting with the celebrated \"The Second Dream\", created a campaign mode in which the solo play is excused, making you feel you\\'re playing the latest adventure of your favorite action saga. Plus these quests tend to unfold mindblowing revelations -the real nature of the warframes- and also new gameplay elements. And there´s nothing like playing them with your warframe wearing the latest fashion additions you managed to acquire after weeks of farming. Because looking fabulous is always important.\\nAlso this game looks pretty. No, that\\'s not quite it... GORGEOUS. There you go.\\nThere\\'s nothing much I can say about this game, other than it keeps growing, let\\'s hope for the better, and I\\'m sure it will deliver more epic experiences in the future.\\nWake up, tenno...',\n",

       " \"Great Game And it's Free! 8/10\\nThe multiplatform free-to-play game is an action shooter with some of the trappings of an MMO. It launched in 2013 and is available now on PC, PS4 and Xbox One, where it is regularly updated. As a recently-awoken space ninja called a Tenno, your job is to fly around the solar system doing space ninja stuff like assassinations, spying on people, stealing information, and performing sabotage. Each mission location and type remains the same, but the missions themselves are somewhat randomized. The game relies on a random tile system to keep things fresh. Your base of operations–and your main menu–is your ship.\\nWhen you log in, you’re sitting in front of your command console, which lets you select where you want to go in the solar system. To your right is the store. To your left is the codex. Behind you, deeper in the ship, are other stations, like the foundry that lets you build weapons or the armory that allows you to outfit and modify your frames.\\nAh, right, frames. The eponymous warframes operate like character classes, except instead of being locked into one class per character, you can swap frames at will, with each frame having four unique powers. For one mission, you might feel like running the supportive frame Trinity, who can mass heal the entire team or provide energy vampire abilities to ensure quick regeneration. On the next mission, you might want to play as Ember, whose incredible World on Fire ability burns every enemy within a massive radius.\\nYou obtain warframes by defeating bosses and getting their parts or by completing some of the game’s great quests. Warframes are not just some cool gimmick or branding idea, but a cool design choice. Two good ideas make them great: first, they’re all overpowered, and second, you have to hunt them down.\\nWarframe doesn’t care about balance. You’re a badass space ninja, after all! Rather than pushing players through a lengthy and meaningless grind, Warframe provides players tons of awesome and incredibly destructive powers. I love running Frost, a frame that launches a massive blast of ice, freezing everything around it, killing most low-level enemies. Playing like Frost feels like running around as a tactical nuke. The sheer destructive power being wielded is awe-inspiring, but that’s true of every frame. Valkyr’s power is invulnerability. It comes at the expense of ranged weapons, but that’s fine, because as a space ninja, your swords are just as cool, if not cooler, than your guns.\\nWhat’s great about being overpowered is that, since everyone is overpowered, no one is. The power you wield makes you feel like you’re actually a badass space ninja, because you’re killing lots of enemies quickly and efficiently. Other sci-fi games, like Mass Effect 2, force you into cover through a lack of health and a focus on small groups of enemies. There’s no sense of lethality or badassery going on when your character feels like they’re made of soggy toilet paper while enemies can last through an entire magazine of gunfire. Warframe understands this, so every frame feels fun to play, because every frame has powerful, over-the-top capabilities.\",\n",

       " '(I played this game over 1500 hours.. so maybe time to write a review?)\\nWARNING: This review might be on the long side but very informative, I\\'ll try to keep it short. (or read only the parts that might be usefull to you)\\nQ and A will be done at the end.\\n[NOTE English is not my main language so it might contain typo\\'s]\\nGametype:\\nThe game is a 3rd person action PvE shooter, but there is a small area for PvP.\\nThe maximum in PvE is 4 players in a game/match. PvP 4VS4 max.\\nThe game is a grind game what you need to like to keep playing. All \"warframes\" and weapons can be lvled to lvl30.\\nThere is also a player rank that only can be increased by the amount of weapons and warframes you have done.\\nScene:\\nThe genre and scene are placed in the future where you play a ninja kind of warrior called \"Tenno\". These warriors use the old ways of fighting with gun and blade. (rifles, shotguns, snipers, pistols, swords, hammers and way more)\\nYou\\'ll start out of a pod with no memory of your past. At that point you only know you got 1 enemy and those are the \"Grineer\". A massive clone army that are trying to get control over the solar system.\\nThis way you have to find, read and listen to any kind of piece you find todiscover what happend in the past with your fellow Tenno\\'s and yourself.\\nGameplay:\\nThe starting campaign is a nice introduction to get a bit known to the game. Varius gametypes are being shown at ya, some suit players better then others. This is a good thing to be with more.\\nAfter that the campaigns are not that well created and just to pull through and get the rewards. until far later in the solar system where there are suddenly a bunch of campaigns that give you a huge eyeopener.\\nNOTE: for this you\\'ll have to reach Uranus.. (yeah, ha ha... =.=\\' planet with the funny name to finally get some action.)\\nEvery Warframe and weapon acts different. Some Warframe got strong powers while others can survive longer under combat conditions.\\nTo navigate over the solar system you\\'ll need to play missions and unlock gates to go from planet to planet. these gates will stay unlocked ones opened. For each gate AKA \"junction\" you open you\\'ll get rewards, like new campaign and weapons.\\nThe starter weapons can be bought in the market of ingame \"credits\". Later weapons you can only buy weapon blueprints. These weapons need components to be build. This can take 12 till 24 hours, warframes might take longer sinse you have to build multible parts.\\nThere is also a payed value called \"platinum\". with this you can buy right away other weapons or warframes.\\nThen there is a last value called \"ducats\" but those can only be used at the trader ones every 2 weeks.\\nComponents can be found in every mission. Every planet got different components you need to build your gear.\\nA good tip is to pick up a much stuff that you\\'ll find lingering on the ground or in crates. This is only benefit for later projects.\\nWarframes and weapons can be changed in color to what you prefer. Some of them can be changed by style also. \\n[NOTE all cosmetics can only be bought with platinum. while ALL weapons and most frames can be grinded and be played. It might take longer and more time to get it, but it\\'s not impossible]\\nWarfame parts can be found defeating bosses. you might have to do it a few times but then you can get the blueprint of that warframe in the market.\\nWatch out how many times you defeat then though. It might attracted unwanted attention from those that hide in the shadows.\\nOnce you got a weapon or warframe you can mod it to make it even become better. Mods can be found through matchs by killing enemies or as rewards for particular missions. There are hunderds of mods to work with and those mods can be upgraded too!\\nCommunity:\\nThe community is really nice especially for those that get started. If you ask in your region chat for info there are most of the time at least 2 or 3 players to help you out.\\nAlthough there are also players that might complain about any of the updates (sometimes right, sometimes wrong. every game got those)\\nDevelopers and updates:\\nDevelopers will keep on their youtube channel and forums you up to date at least one or twise a month. On the youtube channel they also reward/highlight players and artists for anything they created based on the game.\\nUpdates are being added from time to time. These updates bring also bugs with it. The developers most of the time solve these issues within the day or within the week.\\nQ and A:\\nQ: can you be revived in a match? A: yes, once you lose your health you\\'ll lay on the ground for a while so other can revive ya. after that time you got 4 revive to respawn per match.\\nQ: platinum can i only get that by paying money? A: No, you can play a gamemode called void fissures. If you got a relic (what you\\'ll more of eventually) out of those relics come prime parts. These prime parts can be traded. search and ask for correct prices but you\\'ll be able to get platinum that way pretty fast. As long you sell the right parts for the right price.\\nI suggest to grind the parts and weapons you need. and keep platinum for all kind of cosmetics you want (example a nice color pallet so you can properly give you weapons and frames a nice style)\\nQ: Can you make clans? A: yes, clans can be created. these clan also get their own base called a \"dojo\". These dojo\\'s must be build up from scratch though and require a bunch of components to do so.\\nYou can expand your dojo, but that also means parts and research is going to cost more too. The reason all members should help to build it. you got 5 variants of clan sizes.\\nGhost: Max 10 players.\\nShadow: Max 30.\\nStorm: Max 100\\nMountain:  Max 300\\nMoon: max 1000\\nIn Dojo\\'s you can research and buy Blueprints of weapons you might not find in the market.\\nQ: ducats, how to get those? A: at a relay (a place all tenno can come together) you can trade prime parts also for ducats at 2 consoles. once every 2 weeks comes the trades at one of the 3 relays to show mods and other items that you cannot find anywhere else.\\nNote: not all relays are right away available. first relay is for player ranks (MR) 0+ the next is for MR 4+ and the last is for MR 8+.\\nQ: who are hiding in the shadows? A: It would be a shame to spoil that right? You need to find out yourself like anybody else did. :)\\nHope this gives enough information for the starters.\\nWhat I found pretty funny and yet showing how beginning players start :P',\n",
       " 'My review of Warframe\\nWarframe is an amazing game with a truly original story and setting.\\nIn the year 2029 Austria, birth place of Hitler, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Money Boy  and Joseph Fritzl decided to place a ban on all other forms of national production. Farms were closed, factories shut down and local stores were forced out of business. The only businesses allowed to operate were the ports, for importing food to feed the now practically enslaved workforce. All national production refocused on the construction of the \"Door Frame\" Austria\\'s answer to your door hanging needs.\\nBy the year 2031 rogue factions within the Austrian government decided it was time to strike, uploading a selective virus in to the entire nations production lines. This led to the creation of the \"War Frame\" a door frame so focused on war that it caused conflict wherever it was mounted, homes across the globe now featured Austrian doorframes and unfortunately a rogue batch of Warframes were also set loose across the globe.\\nThese Warframes were notorious, sealing front doors to homes to prevent you visiting your neighbours, sealing doorways to places of worship so people could no longer pray to their chosen gods and gradually over time the world fell to darkness and chaos, as even the doorways to power plants and gas stations refused to open.\\nSome Warframes gained sentience and self awareness and as they saw the human uprising finally coming to fruition, their evil colleagues and companions burned in the streets and smashed to splinters they rose up to assist their human allies in the fight against their own kind.\\nYou take the role of one of nineteen types of Warframe, from Oak, to pine to cedar wood. The choices are limitless, your skills totally customizable, from \\'tea tray services\\' to \\'Opening for the elderly\\'. As one of the newly freed warframes, you must take up the mantle of free-DOOR-m fighter, fighting across not only earth but the moon, Mars and Titan to free the oppressed human people from their true foes, the evil Warframes of the Austrian Mega-doorframe-corp.\\n11/10 would open and close door again.',\n",
       " 'You now that pleasant feeling when dopamine levels spike up in your prefrontal cortex and striatum? You know, that sense of reward and achievement? Well, Warframe is all about that - sense of illusory achievement in a virtual environment (which game isn\\'t?). Mostly, because you set up goals to get stuff and then you get it. To put it shortly Warframe = farming with guns. But it doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s bad.\\nIt\\'s actually very fun.\\nThere\\'s plenty of content. I have 200 hours on record and I still haven\\'t mastered all the gameplay elements and unlocking everything would take me another year or more (since the developers keep updating the game all the time).\\nDon\\'t be put off that it\\'s F2P, because you can get everything for free (except for skins and extra slots) - it just takes a lot of farming. Warframe is NOT P2W.\\nSo why is Warframe so fun?\\n- Ninja parkour: wall runs, slides, slide kills, bullet time, zipline kills, double jumps, ground slams...Warframe is a very fast-paced game and offers numerous ways how to kill with style.\\n- Unique abilities for different characters – choose your own \"pokemon\" and master it! Wreak havoc and assist your team!\\n-Friendly community - always someone around to help you out on a mission or trade with you.\\n- Clans - build your own dojo - vast customisation and research options – or join others to facilitate your progress through cooperation\\n- Tons of weapons, mods, sentinels/kubrows (pet or machine assistants) and warframes (suits) – most of the time you spend farming and upgrading stuff\\n- Your own ship - place where you build stuff\\n- Relays - places where you meet other players, trade for prime stuff, interact with syndicates (earning standing points unlock useful stuff)\\n- Archwing missions - Star Wars like shooting in the outer space!! (How cool is that?!)\\n- Quests - special missions with story and special rewards\\n- Various type of missions - plan your next step according to your desires or goals; there\\'s enough to choose from, so that you don\\'t feel bored\\n- Cool and challenging bosses - special reward drops and a bit of \"story\" that freshens up the farming experience\\n- Feeling of being a total badass hacking, slashing and shooting enemies across the Solar System\\nThere are some cons though, too:\\n- Paid content is too expensive without discount (I recommend to wait for random 75% discount on daily login rewards and to spend platinum on slots, orokin reactors/catalysts and formas (although you can build the latter three from rare BPs)\\n- Extra slots cost money (understandable) and there\\'s a certain pressure to purchase it, otherwise you can\\'t build a nice arsenal\\n- Farming is long (although it\\'s understandable, why would otherwise people would be motivated to buy something)\\n- Most other players rush out through the missions - which is kind of bad, if you want more time for looting\\n- Don\\'t like the Forma thing for polarity change - you reset your rank to zero and start all over again just to have extra space for mods\\n- Gamepad is not fully supported (some things don\\'t work)\\n- Solo is not possible for all missions - some are just too hard\\nAnyway, Warframe is a fun and addictive game. The best F2P game ever!\\nMy overall rating: 9/10',\n",
       " \"I often see reviews from people that have not had enough time in-game to truley judge it.  This review is from a very experienced (addicted) member of the warframe community, in-game, on the forums and the wikia.  \\nThis game consists of a unique combat style that allows for fluid change between melee and gunplay.  The enemies are currently a bit dumb, but as is the nature of this game, that may (as been mentioned by devs to most likely happen) change by further improving the pathing of enemies, and differenciating combat tactivs more between enemy type and faction.  The lore is currently hard to find, though based on community smarts, information attained from the codex (think pokemon with some added goodies) and the devoloper livestreams and posts.  The Lore is good, and there's enough room for speculation that allows for some interesting discussions/theorys.  The difference of experience between first playing, having a hold on the combat/movement along with having a decent arsenal, and then what is dubiously called 'end-game' is immense.  Starting off may feel slow, with the generic assualt rifle, pistol and long sword at your desposal.  Enemy factions are slowly introduced as you progress through planets, and bring a different style of play with them.  The grineer follow basic shooter patterns (aim for head, avoid hit scan weapons and some heavies), the corpus is more about reaction to shots than anticipation of them while keeping on your feet, as well as having a 90% resistance to damage taken to the head, or until you put a few rounds into their helmet and send it flying (so for once, the foot might be better than the face), and the infested, a pridominantly melee faction with pack mentality and zerg rush style tactics.  Once you progress, you begin to make your arsenal unique through mods (extra stat cards) that are dropped via RNG (Random Number Generater) when you defeat an enemy.  Weapons are not as important as getting mods to start off.  These mods allow you to take advantage of enemy resistances and status effects, as well as pure damage increase.  As you complete missions, real time alerts become available, which is a good way to get credits (basic currency) and items to improve your weapons, and skins and weapon that are either alert exclusive, or otherwise only obtainable from the market for plat (the games premium currency).  Mods affect your weapons ability and to some extent, the playstyle of that weapon, but there is also a large number of unique weapons (with more added almost every week) that will allow you a diverse arsenal of playstyles.  All weapons are attainable for free (throught the market under the blueprint section, or from farming other areas and bosses, or events).  At mid game, the fighting starts to pick up, and more avenues for play start becoming apparent.  At end-game, your mastery will have been substaintial increased (the psuedo overall player level based on number of weapons maxed), your arsenal will be full, you will have tried most of the warframes (classes), mods will not be a problem allowing min-max builds, and you will be focusing on farming Defence or Survival missions.  This, as the end-game gets a little tedious, and at times, unbearable if you can not find a good group o fplayers, or even a single mate.  Enemy level increase (damage dealt, able to soak up, and number of enemies) is really all the diffulcultty increase that there is.  New content is always being added, so the focus on what is end-game may very well change.  \\nOn a slightly different note, this game has its fair share of bugs (96% are no where near game breaking) and refining damage models, optimisation for more systems, and overall increase in stabilty are always being improved.  \\nAlthough this is advertised as a co-op, ninja game, co-operation is not a strong focus with the community.  lobby options such as solo, private (only friends can join) or invite only help with getting into the game at your own pace, or with a set group of friends you are chatting to.  Trailers depict a large amount of co-ordination of warframe abilities, but this in practice, is lesser.  A large portion of abilities are pure damage, with a few twist between playstyles, and the abilities that support the team mostly do not need another ability to contribute the most that it can.  Rushers are rampant in online public lobbies, and as there are end-game players only going into missions for a single purpose, they rush past everything else, which as a new player can be a bip, shall we say, disorientating.  The learning curve to be able to play this game is not steep, but the learning curve to master the game certainly is.  Each enemy has their own resistances and vulnerabilities, and modding for certain enemies can be the difference between life and death in this game.  All resistance info can be found in-game, but only after scanning enemy types for information int he codex.\\nIf that wall of text was too much to read, then I will sum things up easier before rounding this review off with my opinion.\\n Positive\\n- Uniqure combat style\\n- A plethora of weapons, and customization\\n- Warframes often feel unique, but familiar enough to learn to love\\n- Damage system offers a large amount of info to get sunk into, further increasing some peoples interest in the game mechanics, and devoloping weapon and warframe builds.\\n- Game is constantly being updated, with fixes to community voiced issues, gameplay performance, new weapons and warframes, as well as events, invasions and real time alerts.\\n- Everything that is not cosmetic, or convienience can be attained for free.\\n- Devolopers are part of our community,\\nNegatives\\n- Farming gets repetitive after a while unless you change play styles.\\n- With constant updates, it also brings new bugs.\\n- Your personal objective may be hindered by rushers, and their objective.\\n- End-game consist of two generic mission types to rank equipment.\\nIn summation, my personal feelings about this game are tilted towards loving it (when its not throwing a devoloper induced fit) and plenty of patience.  The experience is enjoyable, and there is a lot to go in-depth based on lore or gameplay mechanics.  The devolopers are always answering questions, and taking feed back.  Yes I have put money into this game, but only the equivalent of a low budget disc game.  I highly recommend giving this game a try for at least 15 hours before making a final decision.  Get to know regular players, and the farming can be easily broken up with informal conversation, which I consider great, as the tenno are a family.  I have maxed almost every item in the game, ahve all available mods, and till have an erge to check in every day to see what smal, large, or passive things have changed.  Try this game, and you will never feel the same about any other game after.\",\n",

Once you get into it, you won't come out, easily anyways. \\nThe community is also pretty non-toxic. Since trading items is a colossal part of warframe, everyone's pretty darn polite (which I think really is being polite to your money, but we might as well ignore that, eh?), and it feels good. \\nBut what I REALLY like about Warframe is that you can access the paid DLC content for FREE, (which is not just in game currency) if you grind hard enough, and that is something I haven't seen in other games.\\nThere you go, my opinions.

Modding allows you to constantly decide what upgrade you want to add to your weapon or warframe on every level-up. This can either make your weapon best stronger versus a certain faction, very fun to play with, or, very simple and sometimes very weak. It can take a while to find the best mods for weapons but when you get them the whole experience changes for the better! What more could you want?

The actual gameplay isn\\'t even bad.\\nBut the game is flawed.\\n1) Welcome to grindland.\\nIt\\'s basicaly a huuuuge grind. Everything can be either bought with money or grinded, but buying in-game items with real cash is out of the question because of the ridiculously high \"platinum\" prices.\\nBut hey, who wants to pay to get stuff anyway right? Go out there and farm that orokin golden bling bling gear, mighty space ninja!\\nAs much as  I like the fact this is a TRUE free to play, I just can\\'t stand game where the sole sense of achievement you get from playing it is about your possessions. In fact, the entire rank of your account is based on how many different weapons you own. Doesn\\'t that give you a slight hint on how much of a grinding simulator this is?\\n2) \"Balance? what is that lawlzors\"\\nI started playing at update 8. That was almost 3 years ago. \\nAt times, some weapons were already better than others, but not by that much (eg. Boltor). You could run any set of gear and still enjoy all the different playstyles they provide. but as the game progressed over the years, it was crippled by some MAJOR powercreeping. To this day, those weapons I played with at update 8 are completely useless. Some of them had slight buffs, but are still absolute trash (see Lanka for instance). Basicaly all the \"top gear\" that all those high level players use are either  a new weapon that\\'s blatantly overpowered (Just think of the Soma when it came out) or a prime variant of it, which is basicaly a better, shinier version of a gun, that sometimes is already too strong, because the devs have zero knowledge in how to balance the game (Soma prime?! What a good idea!).\\nWhat this means is that to run harder missions, the best choice of gear will always be that one new weapon that\\'s just stronger than the rest, not that cool polearm you loved so much, simply because it\\'s being outclassed by that one new melee weapon that just came out, or whatever else is considered the best weapon at times. This restricts a ton of different playstyles from being anything near viable. Want to play a Sniper zephyr with glaive with the Vectis\\'s unique playstyle? Well sorry, but the glaive is old, thus underpowered, and a new sniper just came out which is better than the vectis by a long shot. Yeah, I had that happen to me.\\nIt\\'s just a race to aquire the strongest weapons, which are then replaced when a new patch brings out something better. Meanwhile older but sometimes more fun gear are left in the closet accumulating dust due to their innefectiveness. Playstyle diversity is a joke is this game. Even the many different classes have only one, 2 rarely, viable build for the late game.\\n-=Conclusion=-\\nThe reason why I can\\'t recommend this game is probably because I grew up, and started to dislike games centered about grinding and possessions. Yeah, Warframe\\'s gameplay is good, but you\\'ll never jump into a mission telling yourself \"I\\'m here to have a nice game\" , but instead thinking \"I\\'m here to get X item\". Some of my friends enjoy these types of game, so if that\\'s your thing, go ahead and jump in.

       " \"This game hs the potiental but devs are to concerntrated in trying push new content instead of fixing the current problems that have.\\nThe community is far to toxic, its not just the chinese and russians but they play a huge part in the toxicity of the PvP servers. \\nUnfortunately not much can be done on that unless regionlocking which would screw the game further. They've made it far to easy for the mega tribes to greif servers constantly and persisting to do so weeks on end and the only thing you can do is have a constant watch on the server and get up at times when your server is quietest. \\nSmall tribes or even medium tribes dont stand a chance as they can transfer from server to server which high quality gear,  dino's, rafts and turrets and merely mess with the server for hours on end. Dev's have once again screwed up massively. The game has to be a full time commitment or not point playing.\\nThis being said there is good points to the game dont get me wrong, there are ways around the constant grinding and hardwork. Personally i play offical as its more sense of an acheivement but also means every single loss of item, gear or dino hurts that little more.\\nYou can have fun and there are multiple offical servers which arent full of those bigger tribes who raid you for no reason other then the fact that they're either scared or arent big enough to do proper raiding. \\nAll in all this game is good, has alot to work and should be worked on instead of releasing more  new stuff.\",\n",

The game has good features but the devs insist to follow other developers in making another grind fest so that only larger groups (tribes) can achieve any content. This was their worst nerf bat by far that has made this one of worst grinding games. \\nNow for ranting\\n* Devs keep turning game into another endless grind game. Anything we discover to increase production so tribe can move into content of game, they listen to a few whiners and nerf bat to increase the grind.\\n* Happy you got an mastercraft or ascendant blueprint for that sword? It only took you months of grinding, taming, breeding and leveling to get it out of that snow cave or water cave that you just lost your mossa to. Now go grind 1,400 metal and craft all that metal into a light weight sword. Cause 1,400 lbs  of metal will only weight 5 lbs when you pound it on the smithy. Now that you took all that time to gind mats to craft your sword. Watch the devs toss in more and more dinos that will steal your sword. Shock you to death where you can\\'t swing sword to defend. Knock you off flyer to your death.  But hey.. you did get to hold that sword for 10 minutes!  They\\'ll have 5 new dinos next week to make you lose your gear in more ways. And don\\'t forget! Next week they\\'ll nerf your grinding again so you appreciate those 10 minutes of holding sword even more!  .... \\n* \"Duke Nukem Forever\" has nothing on how long this game will be \\'Beta\\'\\n* \"OMG we added something that turned out benificial to players!

       " 'I have played over 1300+ hours on Ark Survival Evolved.\\nAfter experiencing in full what the game has to offer.\\nI am very happy to see that the VAST MAJORITY who\\'s played Ark are united on the same page and feel the same way about this game.\\nThat general consensus being that this game had great potential but the developers has done nothing to help it\\'s community in achieving what it\\'s player base wanted.\\nArk is fun in some ways. However, it is THE MOST TIME CONSUMING game you will ever play. This is due to the system of the game which offers no balance to new players or fresh players that have just come to a new server. The aim of the game has become to oppress the newcomers and to never trust a single outsider, sometimes even the members of your own tribe who may seek to overthrow you.\\nAs the leader of an official server, despite having achieved all I needed to achieve to be at the top, I soon realised it was taking me 3-4 hours of daily maintenance in order to ensure my base was up to date and secure. To spend that much time just to be on a game NOT TO PLAY, but to complete \"Chores\" in order to survive in a game before being able to play in it is much too ridiculous if I may say so.\\nThe bugs and glitches are many and yet the devs continue to implement and add new things and creatures to the game without improving the gameplay or optimization one bit.\\nEXAMPLES INDLUDE: You can easily get stuck in rocks and die of a glitch anytime. You can sit down on a chair you made and try to fish and suddenly you die due to some completely unexpected glitch is just fkn unacceptable.\\nWith all of this being said, there are still quite a few things that aren\\'t quite right with Ark. Whilst many of us have supported Ark\\'s Developers and invested much of our hard earned money in hopes of seeing this game come to fruition. None of this has come true for us. To add a final bitter aftertaste for all of us loyal supporters who helped support this game for years, we are then forced to an Ultimatum to either purchase the game for the full price or not be able to play this game even after paying $30 USD for a poor Early Access which required financial aid from a then non-existent player base.\\nHaving given a piece of mind, I bid this game farewell. AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE.\\nJUST PLAY A BETTER GAME AND SUPPORT BETTER DEVELOPERS.\\nHave a good one. Thanks for reading.\\nP.S - Thank you to the Ark Developers who created something that had some great features in it and for enabling me to make some great moments and memories through the game. Sorry I am unable to support you any longer. Good bye.',\n",
       " 'There are simply some games that I cannot write a proper review for due to a lack of space, so Ill try to be breif, keep in mind, theres no \"Yes and no\" recommendation, I chose negative because people wanting to see the reasons to avoid the game may gain more from my review, I recommend the game for some and not for others, as seen at the bottom. \\nArk is a game that should be considered a dream. The concept is something every child dreamed of, a world of riding dinosaurs, having them as pets, exploring? What kid didnt wish for that at some point??\\nThe issue is the direction Ark is being developed in. Heres the scoop. The game devs play much more to the massive clans of gamers who have all day to play and keep bases, this is understandable since most of those players are wholly devoted to the game, get more gamers on to join their clan, etc.\\nSo to put it in perspective, the games progression goes Cavemen gear>Cowboy gear>futuristic assault gear and bases of metal with generators and such. You can probably see the issue with this, is that theres a massive leap, and to compound it, most content is endgame content. \\nThis means a simple thing, you and your buddy, 2 people, are wholly, and totally, dead. You will never, ever make it past the age of basic firearms. In Vanilla gameplay, it will take you literal weeks of constant work to get anywhere IF You are never snuffed out along the way, this game is designed for massive clans of 20+ people who can play most of the day (Same issue rust has, the only people who get anywhere dont have lives and never leave the computer, therefore never can be offline raided, see?) \\nAs if it wasnt already a bit one sided, they plan on adding MORE endgame content for the bigger clans to chase. the \"Teck\" age of plasma weapons and dinos with plasma cannons on them. \\nThe hugely linear progression with its massive jumps make this game a huge chore to play even in private PVE servers (The only place small groups can play). The fact the devs are adding even more to endgame shows a clear bias toward the big clans that everyone despises for ruling servers. \\nIn addition to this, the game itself is out to get solo or small group players. The way dino\\'s level makes it so you dont know if a dino is going to take 1 shot or 15 shots of your rifle. The levelling system is extremely overdone and defeats immersion by making it feel like playing borderlands with a level 50 friend when you are level 1 (Hint: Your guns do nothing). Thats not even all though! And as a final nail in the solo coffin, you cant learn all the blueprints with one character and that character only unlocks them with level, so you and your little group better plan out in precision who learns what. \\nNow, while so far ive been hard on the game, I reiterate my point that this is a dream game. In a private server with settings designed to make the game a less-hellish experience for small groups, it is super fun! No big clans to kill you, increased rescources and survivability, and suddenly you have a fantastic PVE game that lets you live out some of the fantasies you had as a kid. \\nAll other points are listed below.\\nPROS \\n-Fantastic concept\\n-Incredible array of dinos that can be tamed and used for their own talents (They add dinos in so much that its almost worth complaining that they dont devote that time to other things)\\n-Under proper circumstances for small groups, its a fantastic survival exploring game\\n-For massive clans, its the be all end all in fantastic PVP\\n-Very active dev-team that do seem to honestly care about the game, they are great people.\\n-Very customizeable servers allow you to bypass many of the negatives shown and have fun by doing things like increasing player health and whatnot. \\nCONS\\n-Almost impossible for small groups or solo guys to survive on anything but PVE, private servers or heavily modified unofficial PVP servers. \\n-Huge amount of bugs and crashes, Dinos dont even have pathfinding and cant see obstacles, will happily walk into a wall for an hour, and have gotten stuck in trees since the game first came out and still do. \\n-Easily the worst optomized game ive ever played, 3 minutes to load for me with a SSD (Some people report 45 second load times, I dont doubt this is possible with a top of the line rig (Mine is no potato, custom made and upgraded just months ago) \\n-too little focus on early game content, too much focus on late game content, stated this trend will continue with the \"Teck Tier\" \\n-Released DLC with items that should have been in the base game during early access (Boomerang, Whip, flamethrower, etc, desert armor, etc) \\n-Worst building system of any survival game ive ever played, spend 3 hours to create a tiny base just because of how expensive parts are, the running back and forth because of encumberment, and the finnicky behavior of the system. \\n-Admins are extremely tied in terms of what they can do, the fly command moves you at a snails pace, you cant build or create things without first spawning them, then you have to keep your weight limit in mind as it still applies in god mode and fly mode (Essentially no creative mode)\\n-Many items are nerfed to the point of being useless. Grapple hooks are awesome, but useless that they can only be used once, same with bolas. Sleeping gas doesnt work on dinos, Sleeping gas traps cant be used to help tame dinos, tons of silly rules that just make the creative choices one could make disappear. \\n-Stealth system is next to nonexistant, which is strange in a game where you will spend hours trying to hide from large dinos.\\nRECOMMENDATION\\nIts simple, if you have a top of the line computer and a massive clan and tons of time to give to this game, you should buy it, full price, it is entirely worth it on every level\\nIf you do not have a top of the line computer, DO NOT BUY IT, NO, IT WILL NOT RUN ON YOUR LAPTOP! EVER! I have seen so many people complain on the forums that the game wont run on potato# 221, this has been made clear and YOU are responsible if you buy it for a rig that cant play it!\\nFor people who CAN run it and have small groups or solo, I would hold off until the game is more balanced and fixed up. It can still be a ton of fun, thats not in doubt in any aspect, and the larger the group you have, the more worth it the game will be. For most, this is a game you will want to hold off on until its more complete.\\nSUGGESTIONS\\n-Give a better set of instructions on the \"Sliders\" given when creating a server, no one guesses that setting player resistance to a lower number would make them stronger ingame (Which is exactly how the slider works) \\n-Expand on other epochs and styles besides primitive and superpowered. Give us some stuff in the middle, maybe some things from the age of exploration. Elephant guns for hunters, compound crossbows for the stealthy assassins.\\n-Increase the usefulness of items that arent used much, grappling hooks would be much more common and helpful if they didnt last one shot only, the sleeping gas weapons are a tamers dream, but dont work on dinos, etc. \\n-Return vehicles to the game, and give them to all epochs. Ill happily take a pedal powered vehicle made of vines and Macgyver sweat during early game, helicopters late game, that kinda thing, let there be a choice between dinos and vehicles as they each have merits (And some of us truly do miss the buggy that was removed)\\n-The taming and breeding times for some dinos is entirely insane, (I am talking 9 or more hours of continuous attention under some circumstances, and for breeding and growing a baby, sometimes days)\\n-EDIT FOR TECK\\nI dont need to say much on the new teck tier trailer, it speaks for itself. Are the toys amazing? Yes, does 90% of the trailer show those toys getting used on people who have no chance of survivng an assault by them? Also yes, take that as you will.',\n",

       " \"I enjoy ARK it's a great concept, looks beautiful (if you have a top of the line card to run it) and the interaction with other people on all servers is great. However, this paid DLC release has me rather upset as just the day before it's release I launched ark started a singleplayer game and walked 3 feet to find a brontosaurus have lodged into a rock and unable to be interacted with.\\nFor those of you saying that we shouldn't be complaining about paid DLC, this game is unfinished and they released DLC for an unfinished game.\\nThis is comparable to let us say I bought a car from toyota I paid them up front expecting to build me a car, they sold me on all the features power windows locks heated seats etc. Now my car is kind of finished it has seats but they aren't heated and I have windows but I have to crank them myself. Toyota now decides to releasea new car, my car, but with a different paint job and tells me that if I want this car I have to pay them the same amount as the original unfinished car but I can only have this car if I've bought the first car too.\\nThis is bad business practice, no matter how you look at it.\\nI love playing this game it's great I would like it more without all the bugs. I'm okay with more delays of release date to fix said issues but not if the delays are due to them painting another car to try and sell me without the proper amount of people to work on the original product promised.\\nWhile I want to recommend this game I cannot recommend the company same as I would for Electronic Arts a game backed by an untrustworthy company is not a game that I would tell others to play. Hopefully Wild Card can figure this out and turn something around to persuade much of the community into appreciating them and this game again.\\nEDIT: To add to this argument of you got your $20 worth of time out of the game. This is invalid for the main reason of imagine buying a hot dog and getting 3/4 of said hot dog eating it and being kind of full but still wanting the other quarter. An unfinished undelivered hot dog still leaves me hungry and wanting the last 1/4 of my hot dog.\",\n",
       " \"With over a hundred hours under my belt, I'd say I'm sufficiently versed in ARK to write a review of my own, as redundant as it may be.\\nBefore I begin, I am posting a disclaimer: ARK, at it's core gameplay mechanics, is a fun game. I've played more of ARK than I ever have of the Stomping Lands. But like the Stomping Lands or any other survival game, it's not the game that's the problem, it's the people.\\nAND THIS REVIEW ONLY APPLIES TO PVP SERVERS, MOSTLY OFFICIAL.\\nMy time in official servers are indeed limited. But the mix of what I have seen and reports from my friends and other Ark players tell me that Official servers are bad. One of the moderators has apparently even called them cesspools. Unofficials aren't immune to griefing, but you'll be better off in them.\\nARK: Survival Evolved is a different take on what we wanted since the Stomping Lands. Surviving against dinosaurs and teaming up with friends to harness the awesome strength of these animals and build amazing forts. Sadly, what we have right now is a grief fest with dinosaurs in the background.\\nIt IS the Stomping Lands. Sure, it's prettier, it's got more species and structures and blah blah blah. But I see dinosaurs wandering around aimlessly in ridiculous numbers with no proper herding behavior, angry predators that can chase you forever and kill everything in their path until they die, and people just KoSing and destroying everything in sight. There is little, in its current stages, setting this apart from the Stomping Lands. But there is tons of potential here and the devs can easily move ARK away from its deceased predecessor.\\nAs it stands, ARK's gameplay is like the Stomping Lands in that you're probably going to log on to your stuff being destroyed. The only way to prevent that is to get amazing defences as quickly as you can. I did that once, tamed a bronto before I was even half way to getting the saddle. He became obsolete after Tyrannosaurs were powered up, and a Tyrannosaur that was lower level than him killed him before that patch anyway. I now have my own Tyrannosaur, and my tribe has only been raided one time since we got him...and by raided I mean the people attempted to raid us but our Tyrannosaur ate them all.\\nBefore all the 'hardcore' PvP lovers come yelling at me and calling me a carebear and that I should go to PvE, let me make one thing clear. I don't mind PvP, PvP can be fun, but not as it is now. Let me explain better for those of you who do not have the game yet.\\nLike Rust, which I have not played, ARK uses a 'sleeper' mechanic. You log off, your unconcious body remains in the world for others to do with as they please. If you've worked hard, hopefully you have a decent wall and a few loyal dinosaurs between your loot and any looters. However, the tamed dino AI is somewhat lackluster, as are the sensory ranges of some of the animals over all. And the balancing is even worse.\\nThis game suffers from a bad case of PvO. Player versus Offline. Essentially, you log off, cowardly raiders ride in on their dinosaurs, kill your dinosaurs since your dinosaurs don't attack as fast as mounted ones do, and then proceed to steamroll your base into the dirt, taking all your hard earned goodies with them. The raiders who attacked our base were PvOers. None of my tribe was online. It was only because of our Tyrannosaurus that our stuff is in tact. This sort of stuff will likely be the only combat you ever see, or rather never see. That, or KOSing by fresh spawns or griefing trolls. I was knocked unconcious for a handful of berries and stone pickaxe once. No joke.\\nAs it stands, there is no viable way to defend your base. There are turrets, but you must constantly resupply them with fuel and ammunition. Your dinos are probably going to do jack diddly squat, because someone is always going to have a dinosaur that is stronger than yours, and probably more of them. I can't list the number of animals I've tamed or began taming, only for them to be killed by someone 'fer de lolz'.\\nIf you buy this game as it is now, you will only be met with your work being destroyed, a multitude of times. I play on an unofficial server, and these are apparently better, especially ones where the admins and owners are active, vocal, and friendly. But you WILL lose your work, and you will most likely be offline when it happens.\\nI want to recommend ARK, I do. If you can get your friends together it can be good fun, fleeing from hungry carnotaurs, or doing battle with a tyrannosaurus, but the fact of the matter is that you will encounter cowards who will destroy your work time and again because they're bored or get some sick pleasure out of it. Until the developers can find some cure to the PvO issue, I really just can't say you should buy it right now. You WILL waste your time rebuilding.\\nWill I keep playing it? Most certainly, but the fact of the matter is that the PvO is starting to take its toll in other ways and it's not good. Ruins are being left like confetti on New Years' Eve in Time Square. The coast is littered with abandoned huts and bases, all broken into by griefers or raiders. And likely, the owners were offline when it happened.\\nAs soon as a cure to this ailment is found, I shall change my review. Until then, I just have to say no to buying it, for sake of your time and money. You WILL invest hundreds of hours into this game, I can tell you that. But most of that time should not be spent building back what you had because you actually had to go to sleep, or work, or go to school.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'ve played this grindfest since it had Founder\\'s packs. I\\'ll admit back then I wanted to purchase, wanted to have Founders, but did not trust the game to continue onward to the place it has gotten to. I used to play it a lot, even more than STEAM shows because I had it downloaded before it was added to STEAM. I got up there in Mastery Ranks. I was around when they added the Clans and Dojos (right after Runescape had a similar update coincidence?) I was around when they added the Syndicates. All of that was fantastic, but never left me with the same impression as the Void. I remember very well when the Void was added, and how much of a blast I had in all of those missions.\\nRecent updates have moved away from the void and towards a new method of farming for \"Prime\" loots that feels even grindier than before. Get the Relic, upgrade the relic, go do a normal mission with a fissure open, all missions to find Prime parts are now essentially Executions. Gone are the days where you could sit in a Defense and go 40+ waves for Prime parts. Gone are the days where the Void even matters. Now it\\'s a normal map you can visit to farm for Argon Crystal you\\'ll rarely need. A whole group of tiles, completely useless now. \\nRecent \"Reworks\" have left some Warframes feeling abused and left limp and ragged. Take Trinity for example. THE Medi-Mom frame that heals everything and keeps your squad in enough Energy to spam your stupid kill-frame ability as much as possible. They took a Warframe with the only decent healing ability in the game for about 2-3 years, then nerfed her healing power into the dirt. When that happened I saw numerous people try and use Oberon as a healer. His healing ability has been broken since he was released, but they\\'ll \"rework\" perfectly good frames. \"Rework\" being code for \"nerf\".\\nI don\\'t even know how to go about the community on this game. Half the trade chat will try and scam you for premium currency, the other half will try and scam you for the item at a lower cost than it is \"worth. Half the game is people rushing through an objective, leaving you in the dust to try and figure out the map if you haven\\'t. Getting left behind to wait for elevators, having scrubs set off alarms during Spy missions. Or you go to the Forums for Digital Extreme\\'s \"Contests\" that are the biggest shitfests ever. No one can follow rules, not even the DE staffers who run the garbage contests.\\nTL;DR I used to love this game, but the staff and community have turned it into a heaping♥♥♥♥♥♥pile that I\\'ll probably never play again.',\n",
       " 'An extremely well polished, sleek, sexy third person shooter/hack-n-slash where you take control of a space ninja.\\nWarframe will see you rise from your slumber, at the behest of some broad wearing an impractical visor, who will promptly start telling you what to do, where to go, and how to do it. She will provide such riveting input as \"It\\'s the Grineer!\" and \"Doors sealed.\" and who could forget the classic: \"Why do you spend so much time playing that game?\". From there, you galavant around the solar system slaughtering thousands and doing physically impossible things like:\\n- Operating around Mercury, a planet so close to the sun the average temperature is about 400 degrees.\\n- Traversing a plane of existence populated only by mind-controlled techno-zombies.\\n- Getting the last piece of Rhino Prime.\\nWarframe likes to build itself up as a complex and lore-rich game filled with boatloads of content and a tight combat system.\\nUnfortunately, what it actually is is a more technologically sophisticated version of Farming Simulator. You want that fabulous looking gun from the market? Well get your wallet out because this game will suck you dry like a vampiric ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you don\\'t like spending extortionate amounts of disposable income on a FREE TO PLAY GAME, then tighten your belt, grab your pillow and get ready to play the captivating, soul-crushing experience that is Warframe.\\nThe game\\'s general gameplay is a fun blend of shooting and slashing. Your character carries both ranged and melee weapons, as well as using a set of abilities that come with whichever \"Warframe\"(Class) you choose. These weapons can range from pistols, to rocket launchers, to flamethrowers, to a gun that literally shoots rubix cubes. The variety of these weapons is a major selling point of the game. As it stands right now, there are dozens of weapons to choose from, as well as a great deal of \"classes\", most of which are well thought out and interesting. Some of which make you question the whole \"space ninja\" ideal (really? A water frame?).\\nWhen you first get into Warframe, you\\'ll see all this content, the lovely graphics, the polished sound design and fluid combat and think \"All of this is free to play?! Hot damn that\\'s amazing!\".\\nSadly, this is what most people think before they begin to understand DE\\'s business model.\\nWarframe is a game about grinding. You perform the same missions ad nauseum for the sole purpose of levelling up your weapons/classes, and gathering materials that have a mercilessly low drop rate. If you\\'ve played World of Warcraft, you know the feeling of running the same boss again and again and having it not drop what you want. That concept is applied to this entire game. You will grind. Forever. I\\'ve played for over 850 hours and I only just got every warframe and about 80% of the weapons.\\nIt\\'s a structure of loot-tables and abysmal drop rates designed to stretch the game\\'s overall playing time to the longest possible length. It teases the player with what they could accomplish, and then forces them to spend entire days playing for a single item, only to hit them with hurdle after hurdle. \\nYou want to get a new Warframe (class)?\\nHere\\'s what you need to do:\\n- Play the game until you unlock the planet\\'s final boss.\\n- Grind the boss, many of which feature invincibility phases and can take up to 5 minutes to kill each time even with a full team of players.\\n- Pray to whatever gods you believe in that 1 of 3 \"parts\" drop.\\n- Run the boss again and again for the other 2.\\n- Build each \\'part\\' of the frame, each of which costs even more resources, credits, and literally 12 hours of real-world time.\\n- Buy the \\'blueprint\\' from the marketplace, which is often extremely costly for newer players.\\n- Use your parts to fashion the final Warframe, which will take, and I\\'m not kidding, THREE DAYS TO BUILD.\\nRemember raid lock-outs from WoW? That concept where if you kill a boss you have to wait a whole week until you can kill it again? The same thing exists in this game, but in a different form. You will spend most of your time in Warframe waiting for things to happen. You will wait for weapons/warframes to build. You will wait for the (entirely randomised) alerts to pop up with something good. You will wait for something interesting to happen. It\\'s like if someone made Stormwind into a full game.\\nEvery now and then, the developers will throw out an event, these are usually half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ completely rigged against the player, extremely poorly thought-out, rampant with bugs, and a massive waste of time. But they\\'ll make you feel forced to play the terrible content by granting players that force themelves to endure it a big shiny one-of-a-kind weapon. And it often isn\\'t worth the trouble.\\nThe story isn\\'t much to write home about. You wake up from stasis and find yourself in the middle of a warzone between clones, zombies and jews. From there you stab and slash your way to victory. Victory isn\\'t actually in the game yet though, so you might want to set your sights a bit lower first. Maybe try getting Volt Prime, I dunno.\\nWarframe is a good game. I would even say a great game. It\\'s just dragged down by developers that don\\'t understand how to balance or handle the game they\\'ve created. It\\'s a restrictive, neutured experience which constantly keeps players on the edge. A nefarious business model based entirely around the carrot-on-a-stick method.\\nIf you don\\'t mind grinding, if you have friends that already play this, if you don\\'t mind developers consistently wrecking the game every patch and if you have a great deal of podcasts you need to catch up on, then I would recommend Warframe.\\nIf you want a game that will grant progression based on how much time and effort you put into it, then I would not. The game will slam you with real-life time restraints and force you to wait days for content you already spent weeks grinding for. It\\'s a time-sink in every sense of the term, and it\\'s not enjoyable in that respect. \\nA good game hindered by greedy developers and the micro-transaction business model designed to keep players playing for as long as possible.\\nBut hey, at least Nova has a nice♥♥♥♥♥\\n5/10.',\n",

This game is extremely grindy, but I certainly don't mind, because the core gameplay is solid and enjoyable (albeit with a few snags here and there). There are warframes to suit darn near every playstyle out there, and the 3 frames you get to choose from at the beginning reflect this well. Most importantly.. EVERY warframe and EVERY weapon can be acquired without spending a cent. This is where the grinding comes in. You have to have patience, and play the game. Of course, if you don't have patience, you can always just buy some platinum, and spend that on warframes, weapons, and various cosmetic goodies instead!\",\n",

       " \"The Community:\\n     It isn't cancer. Everyone is friendly, even the veterans who are maxed ranks always are helpful. You will occasionally get a guy who just acts like he's better than everyone else and noone can climb his ego, but you get that anywhere. 9/10 for the community rating.\\nThe Gameplay:\\n     Excellent mix of gunplay, melee combat, ability combat, and companion mechanics! Being able to slide around and jump 50 meters in the air, while shooting an enemy, slamming a giant axe down on another, then unleashing your ultimate on a group in front of you is just always satisfying. There is a variety of missions, weapons, Frames (basically characters), and items to keep you entertained for a long time, and although it does either take a TON of work and time to get these (this can also be bypassed completely by purchasing Platinum, one of the two in-game currencies), it still will keep you feeling acomplished and wanting more. There is also so many combinations/varieties of ways you can mod your weapons, frames, and even companions, to get some awesome buffs and an overall edge in combat. The combat mechanics gets a 10/10 because they literally give you so many combat options, and it is sooo much more polished than what it used to be a few years back.\\nFree to Play? So it's Pay to Win right?:\\n     The game is mainly a co-op game, and there really isn't a competitive aspect to it, so I wouldn't necessarily call it Pay to Win, I'd call it Pay to Skip weeks of hard work and frustration. It is 100% possible to obtain every single item in the game (minus exclusive frames/Items that aren't obtainable anymore, but may be at some point) without shelling out a pennie, but you would be talking months, maybe even a year to complete and catch up with the updates, which they are always adding new stuff to keep it fresh. You are able to obtain Platinum by completing missions and objectives to obtain Prime items (an upgraded version of a weapon/frame) and then sell them to other players in the trading channel for platinum. You could even merch off items if you had the time and bought the right items cheap and sell them for more. All in all, it's not a pay to win game and if you wanted to buy platinum, all you would be doing is supporting the development of the game and thanking them, in a way.\\nNegatives/Complaints:\\n     -The modding system, crafting system, navigation, and sydicate system is criminally underexplained. They need to make it more friendly to new players and make a quest of some sort that has them upgrade a mod to complete a mission in some way and write a lot of dialogue for Ortis to explain how this system works, because I found myself reading the wiki, watching videos, and asking others how these things worked.\\n     -If you are someone who doesn't have a whole lot of time on their hands, you won't really be able to progress much in this game, because it takes a buttload of hard work and time to progress, without spending money on platinum. This game is all about the GRIND. If you don't have time, it will take you even longer to progress in this game.\\n     -At times, the missions become more and more repetitive and it starts to kill your motivation. They are at work at trying to improve these problems and I have faith that it can be done, with time.\\nIn conclusion, I would rate the game 8/10. It has those 10/10 moments all the time though, so its a very full cup sitting at 8/10. Thanks for spending the time to read this review\\nEDIT: Even more amazing with the Plains of Eidolon Update\",\n",
       " 'This game caught my interest months ago, and I was watching it since then. I\\'ve been very cautious about survival games after the past few I tried have all let me down, bigtime. I usually shy away from PvP in games, so naturally I was hesitant to play this one. A few weeks ago, I received it as a gift from my significant other, and finally gave it a shot.\\nFirst of all, what worried me the most about this game, was the many many stories I read about joining and being instantly ganked, being killed in their sleep, being griefed, trolled, and every other horrible PvP thing that can possibly happen. So far I just have not experienced this. Maybe I have just been very lucky....but so far I have not yet ran into someone who instantly tried to kill me. Everyone has been friendly, saying hello on voice, offering supplies, and I even met a tribe leader that took me into the tribe to teach me the basics. I just have not seen the toxicity that some other reviews talk about. But again, maybe I just got lucky. \\nThe game is beautiful. A screenshotter\\'s paradise. It is graphics intensive but Im able to play on high without many issues (I get short freezes when I enter a new biome while flying, that\\'s about it). There are also frequent latency issues on the official servers. \\nContent is added all the time. It seems like every few days there is a new dino being added, and there are pretty much daily updates. I saw many negative reviews that say \"the devs don\\'t care\", but I am not sure where that idea came from. Maybe I\\'m missing something, but they seem quite passionate about the game to me. \\nFor me the game is very addictive. It is HARD for me to get \"sucked into\" a game on Steam. I usually play for about 12 hours and then move on. But so far in Ark I\\'m at 60 hours and usually log off still wanting to play more.\\nThere are some small things that bug me, and they are kinda silly things...mainly the artistic freedom the devs use on the dinos. I know they said they aren\\'t going for total accuracy, but small things like the Stego having 6 tail spikes instead of 4 makes me roll my eyes. Same with the two downwards-pointing horns on the Ankylo\\'s chin. Just minor things.\\nOverall for me, the game is one of the best I\\'ve played on Steam so far. I am really loving it, and look forward to logging in every night.',\n",

       " 'Ark used to be a great game and really fun, the things that made the game so fun and great is still there!\\nBut as the game is right now with large tribes claiming servers instead of land on a server. \\nThe endless barrage of explosives, dinos and gear that server transfers gives is just to game breaking. \\nEven on servers that has ARK downloads disabled you will be hunted by tribes that is able to transfer servers.\\nGame is fun, game is great, fighting for your place on the server is always a must.

Its a terribly repetitive game with more farming going on then in Alabama. The characters leave a lot to be desired, having the most attractive and pleasing models reserved for only the most elite. That said there are positives aplenty about the game. Its a free to play that does not micro charge you at every turn. There are tons of things you can throw your money at but your paying because your lazy and you want the items now. Its pay because your a bunch' lazy Laurens not pay to win! The developers apparently keep in contact with the community and listen to what they have to say, unlike other corporations like infinityward and treyarch... Or youtube. I personally only play this game because a very sexy, kind and sweet idividual has seduced me into going through the long download and patching process to play with them. Curse these hormones! All in all it depends on you, do you like MMO's? Are you hot enough to make your friends play with you? Like shooter slashers from third person views?
